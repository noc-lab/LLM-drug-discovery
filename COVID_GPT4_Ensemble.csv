Title: BRD2 inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing transcription of the host cell receptor ACE2
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted a targeted CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. Here we show that the protein BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells, including those of human nasal epithelia. Moreover, pharmacological BRD2 inhibition with the drug ABBV-744 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Syrian hamsters. We also found that BRD2 controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates the antiviral response. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Yes, this paper does identify an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach.

In the paper, the authors identify BRD2, a protein, as a critical regulator of ACE2 transcription, which is the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into human cells. Therefore, BRD2 becomes a point of interest as a potential drug target to control SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To uncover this target, the authors conducted a targeted CRISPRi (CRISPR interference) screen, which is a wet-lab technique involving genetic manipulation to knock down or degrade specific biological targets. The aim of the CRISPRi screen in this context was to discover druggable pathways that control the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to human cells.

The authors also tested the effect of a known BRD2 inhibitor, ABBV-744, both in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (Syrian hamsters), and found that it effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. These experiments that involve inhibition studies in a physical lab setup also qualify as wet-lab approaches.

In summary, this paper used a combination of genetic screening and drug inhibition studies to identify BRD2 as a potential drug target for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, which constitutes the usage of a wet-lab approach.

Title: Targeting stem-loop 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR to suppress viral translation and Nsp1 evasion
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; therapeutic; translation.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that evades antiviral immunity by interfering with host protein synthesis, mRNA stability, and protein trafficking. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the messenger RNA (mRNA) entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here, we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the stem-loop 1 (SL1) region of the SARS-CoV-2 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration, as well as providing protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethality in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus' own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade-off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.","The paper does indeed identify a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The researchers here have identified the stem-loop 1 (SL1) region of the SARS-CoV-2 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) as a key player in the virus's mechanism to evade the host's immune response, specifically, the suppression caused by the virus's nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1).

Nsp1, produced by SARS-CoV-2, is known to inhibit host protein synthesis by blocking the mRNA entry channel of the host's 40S ribosome. The virus, however, must circumvent this Nsp1-mediated suppression to allow for its own protein synthesis, necessary for viral replication. The researchers have found that the SL1 region of the virus's 5' UTR plays a crucial role in this evasion mechanism.

They investigated this hypothesis using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides to target SL1, a strategy which they found inhibits viral translation and makes the SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression. This in turn hinders viral replication, as shown in their in vitro experiments. They also found that this approach provides protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethality in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2.

Thus, they effectively identified the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR as a potential drug target and validated this using wet-lab techniques, namely in vitro assays and in vivo studies in transgenic mice.

Title: The complex structure of GRL0617 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro reveals a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) has been implicated in playing important roles in virus maturation, dysregulation of host inflammation, and antiviral immune responses. The multiple functions of PLpro render it a promising drug target. Therefore, we screened a library of approved drugs and also examined available inhibitors against PLpro. Inhibitor GRL0617 showed a promising in vitro IC50 of 2.1 Î¼M and an effective antiviral inhibition in cell-based assays. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLproC111S in complex with GRL0617 indicates that GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor and it resides in the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) domain of PLpro. NMR data indicate that GRL0617 blocks the binding of ISG15 C-terminus to PLpro. Using truncated ISG15 mutants, we show that the C-terminus of ISG15 plays a dominant role in binding PLpro. Structural analysis reveals that the ISG15 C-terminus binding pocket in PLpro contributes a disproportionately large portion of binding energy, thus this pocket is a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery targeting PLpro.","The paper titled ""The complex structure of GRL0617 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro reveals a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery"" describes a wet-lab approach to identifying a potential drug target in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.

The protein targeted in this study, known as papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro), is part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and plays crucial roles in virus maturation, as well as the dysregulation of host inflammation and antiviral immune responses. Therefore, PLpro is already intrinsically associated with the disease process of COVID-19, thus fulfilling the definition of a drug target.

The researchers employed wet-lab techniques, including in vitro assays to test the binding and inhibitory activity of the compound GRL0617 against PLpro. The paper notes that GRL0617 demonstrated promising in vitro IC50 values, indicating its ability to inhibit 50% of the PLpro activity at a concentration of 2.1 ?M. The effectiveness of GRL0617 was further validated through cell-based assays, which provided further experimental evidence for its antiviral properties.

Moreover, the study used biophysical techniques to determine the structure of the complex formed between PLpro and GRL0617, showing that GRL0617 acts as a non-covalent inhibitor within the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) domain of PLpro. NMR data and studies with truncated ISG15 mutants were also employed to show that GRL0617 blocks the binding of the ISG15 C-terminus to PLpro.

The use of these experimental approaches, which encompass both in vitro and in vivo assays as well as biophysical techniques for structure determination, clearly falls under the umbrella of wet-lab approaches. Furthermore, these findings reveal that the ISG15 C-terminus binding pocket in PLpro is a hot spot for antiviral drug discovery, thus indicating a potential drug target.

Final Answer: Yes. This paper identifies both an existing (PLpro) and potential (ISG15 C-terminus binding pocket in PLpro) drug target using a wet-lab approach.",1,1,"{

Abstract: The abundance of polyphenols in edible plants makes them an important component of human nutrition. Considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies have investigated polyphenols as bioactive constituents. We applied in-silico molecular docking as well as molecular dynamics supported by in-vitro assays to determine the inhibitory potential of various plant polyphenols against an important SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic target, the protease 3CLpro. Of the polyphenols in initial in-vitro screening, quercetin, ellagic acid, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate and resveratrol showed IC50 values of 11.8 ÂµM to 23.4 ÂµM. In-silico molecular dynamics simulations indicated stable interactions with the 3CLpro active site over 100 ns production runs. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the binding of polyphenols to 3CLpro in real time. Therefore, we provide evidence for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural plant polyphenols, and suggest further research into the development of these novel 3CLpro inhibitors or biochemical probes.","The paper primarily focuses on the inhibition of a SARS-CoV-2 protein called 3CLpro, also known as the main protease, by various plant polyphenols. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro is a crucial protein that the virus uses for its replication, and hence it represents a potential drug target. The authors utilized a combination of in-silico (computational) and in-vitro (wet-lab) approaches to determine the potential of these polyphenols as inhibitors of 3CLpro.

The in-silico approach involved molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to predict how well the polyphenols might bind to the 3CLpro protein. This is a computational method and does not count as a wet-lab approach.

The in-vitro approach, however, does meet the definition of a wet-lab method. It involved a screening test to measure the inhibitory potential (IC50 values) of the polyphenols against the 3CLpro enzyme. This is a hands-on laboratory experiment that physically tests how well these compounds can inhibit the enzyme in a test tube setting. Another in-vitro experiment that was used is surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a biophysical technique that allows for real-time measurement of molecular binding, which in this case was between the polyphenols and 3CLpro.

Title: Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike: ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2
Keywords: ACE2; SARS-CoV-2; antiviral; coronavirus; proteinâprotein interaction; spike protein.
Abstract: Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2), which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50's of 0.2-3.0 Î¼M), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2. While dyes seemed to be promiscuous inhibitors, DRI-C23041 showed some selectivity and inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50's (6-7 Î¼M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.","This paper does indeed focus on a critical drug target for COVID-19 using a wet-lab approach. The target in question is the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is what the virus uses to enter human cells. It does so by binding to the hACE2 receptor on human cells, which initiates viral attachment and cellular entry. Therefore, if a molecule can be identified that effectively inhibits this interaction, it has the potential to prevent the virus from entering human cells and, thereby, prevent the infection.

The wet-lab approach utilized in this study involved screening a compound library for potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of this PPI. In particular, the researchers focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. They then tested promising candidates using cell-free ELISA-type assays and protein thermal shift assays. The ELISA-type assays provided a measure of each candidate's ability to inhibit the PPI (its IC50), while the protein thermal shift assays provided evidence for which of the two proteins in the PPI (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or hACE2) the SMIs bound to.

A few molecules were found to inhibit the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with low micromolar activity. Specifically, they found that dyes such as Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue, and two novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) were effective in inhibiting the interaction, while control compounds like sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin showed no activity.

The study also confirmed that the effective SMIs bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and not the hACE2. It's worth noting that the small-molecule inhibitor DRI-C23041 also inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells, which is another proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry.

Title: A novel class of TMPRSS2 inhibitors potently block SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV viral entry and protect human epithelial lung cells
Keywords: COVID-19; PS-SCL; antiviral; protease inhibitor; structure-based drug discovery.
Abstract: The host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 is an attractive therapeutic target for COVID-19 drug discovery. This protease activates the Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and of other coronaviruses and is essential for viral spread in the lung. Utilizing rational structure-based drug design (SBDD) coupled to substrate specificity screening of TMPRSS2, we have discovered covalent small-molecule ketobenzothiazole (kbt) TMPRSS2 inhibitors which are structurally distinct from and have significantly improved activity over the existing known inhibitors Camostat and Nafamostat. Lead compound MM3122 (4) has an IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 340 pM against recombinant full-length TMPRSS2 protein, an EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) of 430 pM in blocking host cell entry into Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells of a newly developed VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus, and an EC50 of 74 nM in inhibiting cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 virus in Calu-3 cells. Further, MM3122 blocks Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cell entry with an EC50 of 870 pM. MM3122 has excellent metabolic stability, safety, and pharmacokinetics in mice, with a half-life of 8.6 h in plasma and 7.5 h in lung tissue, making it suitable for in vivo efficacy evaluation and a promising drug candidate for COVID-19 treatment.","The paper identifies TMPRSS2, a host cell serine protease, as an attractive therapeutic target for COVID-19 drug discovery. The paper mentions that this protease is essential for viral spread in the lungs as it activates the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses.

Regarding the approach, it's clear that the researchers used a combination of computational (rational structure-based drug design) and experimental (wet-lab) methods. They developed small-molecule ketobenzothiazole (kbt) TMPRSS2 inhibitors using rational structure-based drug design (SBDD). This is a computational approach that uses the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biological target to design drugs.

In the wet-lab part, they performed substrate specificity screening of TMPRSS2. Also, they evaluated the efficacy of their lead compound, MM3122, in several experiments. These included in vitro assays to measure the IC50 against recombinant full-length TMPRSS2 protein, and the EC50 in blocking host cell entry into Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells of a newly developed VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus. They also measured the EC50 in inhibiting cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 virus in Calu-3 cells.

Hence, the paper did identify a drug target (TMPRSS2) and evaluated a drug candidate (MM3122) using both computational and wet-lab approaches.

Title: Pyronaridine Protects against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mouse
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; antiviral; pyronaridine; spike protein.
Abstract: There are currently relatively few small-molecule antiviral drugs that are either approved or emergency-approved for use against severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola. We evaluated three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg and identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. The in vivo efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, reducing lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Pyronaridine inhibited the viral PLpro activity in vitro (IC50 of 1.8 Î¼M) without any effect on Mpro, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PLpro inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.","The paper describes the use of an existing drug, pyronaridine, for the potential treatment of COVID-19. The authors suggest that pyronaridine's potential therapeutic effect is due to its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in a specific model of human lung cells (A549-ACE2 cells) and in a mouse model of COVID-19 (K18-hACE transgenic mice). The paper suggests that the mechanism of action of pyronaridine is through the inhibition of the viral PLpro (papain-like protease) activity. The PLpro is an enzyme that is part of the virus's replication machinery, making it a possible drug target for SARS-CoV-2. The researchers assessed the effectiveness of pyronaridine using both in vitro and in vivo experiments, thus using a wet-lab approach.

Specifically, the paper identifies PLpro as the target of pyronaridine, which is determined using in vitro assays (IC50 determination). These in vitro assays are a part of wet-lab approaches, which are non-computational experimental methods to study biological phenomena. The authors also generated several pyronaridine analogs to further understand the structure-activity relationship for PLpro inhibition, which again points towards the usage of a wet-lab approach for determining the molecular target.

The in vivo studies in the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19 also involved determining the effect of pyronaridine on viral load, lung pathology, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. These are also components of a wet-lab approach.

Title: Targeting RNA G-Quadruplex in SARS-CoV-2: A Promising Therapeutic Target for COVID-19?
Keywords: G-quadruplex; RNA; drug discovery; inhibitors; viruses.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a global threat. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G-quadruplexes (G4s) are important noncanonical nucleic acid structures with distinct biofunctions. Four putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were studied. One of them (RG-1), which locates in the coding sequence region of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form a stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4-specific compounds, such as PDP (pyridostatin derivative), can stabilize RG-1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS-CoV-2 N by inhibiting its translation both in vitro and in vivo. This result is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS-CoV-2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and that their biofunctions can be regulated by a G4-specific stabilizer. This finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","The paper ""Targeting RNA G-Quadruplex in SARS-CoV-2: A Promising Therapeutic Target for COVID-19?"" indeed identifies a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. It focuses on the G-quadruplexes (G4s), which are noncanonical nucleic acid structures, in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, it targets one putative G4-forming sequence (PQS) called RG-1 that is located within the coding sequence region of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N).

The authors of the study were able to verify the formation of a stable RNA G4 structure from the RG-1 sequence in live cells. This process was most likely determined using a wet-lab approach, as it would involve direct observation and experimentation in a laboratory setting.

Furthermore, the study investigated the effect of G4-specific compounds like PDP (a pyridostatin derivative) on the identified target. They found that PDP was able to stabilize the RG-1 G4 structure and significantly reduce the protein levels of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein by inhibiting its translation. This was established both in vitro (outside a living organism, such as in a petri dish or test tube) and in vivo (inside a living organism), methods which are both typically associated with wet-lab work.

Hence, the paper not only identifies a new potential drug target, but also demonstrates the effect of a specific molecule (PDP) on this target using wet-lab techniques. This could potentially lead to the development of novel antiviral drugs against COVID-19 by targeting the identified G-quadruplex in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Title: Inhalable nanocatchers for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; hACE2-containing nanocatchers; inhalation; mucoadhesive; virus inhibitor.
Abstract: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), presents an urgent health crisis. More recently, an increasing number of mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified globally. Such mutations, especially those on the spike glycoprotein to render its higher binding affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) receptors, not only resulted in higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but also raised serious concerns regarding the efficacies of vaccines against mutated viruses. Since ACE2 is the virus-binding protein on human cells regardless of viral mutations, we design hACE2-containing nanocatchers (NCs) as the competitor with host cells for virus binding to protect cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hACE2-containing NCs, derived from the cellular membrane of genetically engineered cells stably expressing hACE2, exhibited excellent neutralization ability against pseudoviruses of both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the D614G variant. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in the lung, the most vulnerable organ for COVID-19, we develop an inhalable formulation by mixing hACE2-containing NCs with mucoadhesive excipient hyaluronic acid, the latter of which could significantly prolong the retention of NCs in the lung after inhalation. Excitingly, inhalation of our formulation could lead to potent pseudovirus inhibition ability in hACE2-expressing mouse model, without imposing any appreciable side effects. Importantly, our inhalable hACE2-containing NCs in the lyophilized formulation would allow long-term storage, facilitating their future clinical use. Thus, this work may provide an alternative tactic to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infections even with different mutations, exhibiting great potential for treatment of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.","The paper presents the development of a novel approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections by using inhalable hACE2-containing nanocatchers (NCs). The proposed target for these nanocatchers is not a novel or traditional drug target such as a specific protein or an enzyme, but rather the virus itself, specifically its spike glycoprotein which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) receptors. This is the point of attack for SARS-CoV-2 as it uses this binding to enter host cells and initiate an infection. The nanocatchers, which are derived from the cellular membrane of genetically engineered cells stably expressing hACE2, are designed to act as competitors for virus binding, thus potentially preventing the virus from interacting with host cells.

Regarding the wet-lab approach, the paper indicates that these hACE2-containing nanocatchers were tested for their neutralization ability against pseudoviruses of both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the D614G variant. Additionally, an inhalable formulation of the nanocatchers was developed and tested for its ability to inhibit pseudoviruses in an hACE2-expressing mouse model. Both of these studies would require physical experimentation in a laboratory setting and therefore can be classified as a wet-lab approach.

Title: New Chemicals Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Cell Culture
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2 replication; cell culture; docking; inhibitors; main protease; quantum chemistry.
Abstract: Candidates to being inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 were selected from the database of Voronezh State University using molecular modeling. The database contained approximately 19,000 compounds represented by more than 41,000 ligand conformers. These ligands were docked into Mpro using the SOL docking program. For one thousand ligands with best values of the SOL score, the protein-ligand binding enthalpy was calculated by the PM7 quantum-chemical method with the COSMO solvent model. Using the SOL score and the calculated protein-ligand binding enthalpies, eighteen compounds were selected for the experiments. Several of these inhibitors suppressed the replication of the coronavirus in cell culture, and we used the best three among them in the search for chemical analogs. Selection among analogs using the same procedure followed by experiments led to identification of seven inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture with EC50 values at the micromolar level. The identified inhibitors belong to three chemical classes. The three inhibitors, 4,4-dimethyldithioquinoline derivatives, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cell culture just as effectively as the best published non-covalent inhibitors, and show low cytotoxicity. These results open up a possibility to develop antiviral drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","This paper details a study that used a combined approach of computational modelling and wet-lab testing to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. The specific target the researchers were interested in was the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Mpro is a key enzyme that plays a vital role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it a prime target for antiviral drug development.

The researchers first used computational methods to screen a large database of chemical compounds and identify those with potential binding affinity for the Mpro. From this selection, eighteen compounds were chosen based on their SOL score (a measure of docking, i.e., binding, efficiency) and their calculated protein-ligand binding enthalpy, which reflects the energy involved in the binding process. This part of the research can be considered a dry-lab approach as it involves computational simulation.

The selected compounds were then tested in a wet-lab setting to evaluate their ability to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Several of the tested compounds showed promising results, and further selection and testing identified seven inhibitors with effective concentration (EC50) values at the micromolar level. Among these, three were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication just as effectively as the best published non-covalent inhibitors and showed low cytotoxicity. These inhibitors belong to the 4,4-dimethyldithioquinoline chemical class.

Therefore, while this paper does not directly identify a new potential drug target, it does involve the use of a wet-lab approach to validate computationally predicted inhibitors for an already identified drug target (the main protease of SARS-CoV-2).

Title: DNA aptamers inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein binding to hACE2 by an RBD- independent or dependent approach
Keywords: DNA aptamer; S2-protein; SARS-CoV-2; fusion aptamer; spike-protein.
Abstract: Objective: Nobody knows when the COVID-19 pandemic will end or when and where the next coronavirus will outbreak. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for different variants or even the new coronavirus. Since SARS-CoV-2 uses its surface spike-protein to recognize hACE2, mediating its entry into cells, ligands that can specifically recognize the spike-protein have the potential to prevent infection. Methods: We have recently discovered DNA aptamers against the S2-domain of the WT spike-protein by exploiting the selection process called SELEX. After optimization, among all candidates, the aptamer S2A2C1 has the shortest sequence and the best binding affinity toward the S2-protein. More importantly, the S2A2C1 aptamer does not bind to the RBD of the spike-protein, but it efficiently blocks the spike-protein/hACE2 interaction, suggesting an RBD-independent inhibition approach. To further improve its performance, we conjugated the S2A2C1 aptamer with a reported anti-RBD aptamer, S1B6C3, using various linkers and constructed hetero-bivalent fusion aptamers. Binding affinities of mono and fusion aptamers against the spike-proteins were measured. The inhibition efficacies of mono and fusion aptamers to prevent the hACE2/spike-protein interaction were determined using ELISA. Results: Anti-spike-protein aptamers, including S2A2C1 and S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, maintained high binding affinity toward the WT, Delta, and Omicron spike-proteins and high inhibition efficacies to prevent them from binding to hACE2, rendering them well-suited as diagnostic and therapeutic molecular tools to target SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Conclusions: Overall, we discovered the anti-S2 aptamer, S2A2C1, which inhibits the hACE2/spike-protein interaction via an RBD-independent approach. The anti-S2 and anti-RBD aptamers were conjugated to obtain the fusion aptamer, S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, which recognizes the spike-protein by an RBD-dependent approach. Our strategies, which discovered aptamer inhibitors targeting the highly conserved S2-protein, as well as the design of fusion aptamers, can be used to target new coronaviruses as they emerge.","The paper identifies two DNA aptamers, S2A2C1 and S1B6C3, that have potential as drug targets in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. These aptamers are described as being capable of inhibiting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which is the primary mechanism by which the virus enters human cells. S2A2C1 is said to achieve this through an RBD-independent approach, while S1B6C3, when linked to S2A2C1 to form the fusion aptamer S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, employs an RBD-dependent approach.

The research methods used in this paper to discover and optimize these aptamers clearly fall under the ""wet-lab"" category. The SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) process used to identify the aptamers is a wet-lab technique that involves physically conducting non-computational experiments. The binding affinities of the aptamers against the spike-proteins were measured, and their abilities to inhibit the hACE2/spike-protein interaction were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which are also wet-lab techniques.

In conclusion, the paper identifies potential drug targets - the DNA aptamers S2A2C1 and S1B6C3 (in its linked form as S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1) - using wet-lab techniques.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern will continue to emerge for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. To map mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that affect binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we applied in vitro evolution to affinity-mature the RBD. Multiple rounds of random mutagenic libraries of the RBD were sorted against decreasing concentrations of ACE2, resulting in the selection of higher affinity RBD binders. We found that mutations present in more transmissible viruses (S477N, E484K and N501Y) were preferentially selected in our high-throughput screen. Evolved RBD mutants include prominently the amino acid substitutions found in the RBDs of B.1.620, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants. Moreover, the incidence of RBD mutations in the population as presented in the GISAID database (April 2021) is positively correlated with increased binding affinity to ACE2. Further in vitro evolution increased binding by 1,000-fold and identified mutations that may be more infectious if they evolve in the circulating viral population, for example, Q498R is epistatic to N501Y. We show that our high-affinity variant RBD-62 can be used as a drug to inhibit infection with SARS-CoV-2 and variants Alpha, Beta and Gamma in vitro. In a model of SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamster, RBD-62 significantly reduced clinical disease when administered before or after infection. A 2.9 Ã cryo-electron microscopy structure of the high-affinity complex of RBD-62 and ACE2, including all rapidly spreading mutations, provides a structural basis for future drug and vaccine development and for in silico evaluation of known antibodies.","This paper employs a wet-lab approach to study the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Specifically, the paper employs in vitro evolution to affinity-mature the RBD, with multiple rounds of mutagenic libraries sorted against decreasing concentrations of ACE2. This process results in the selection of higher affinity RBD binders.

In doing so, the paper highlights that mutations present in more transmissible viruses were preferentially selected in the high-throughput screen. It also points out that these findings mirror the increased prevalence of specific RBD mutations in the population, as per the GISAID database. Additionally, further in vitro evolution resulted in a 1,000-fold increase in binding and identified mutations that might make the virus more infectious if they were to evolve in the circulating viral population.

Most importantly, one of the RBD variants studied, RBD-62, was shown to inhibit infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants Alpha, Beta, and Gamma in vitro. Moreover, when used in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters, RBD-62 significantly reduced clinical disease when administered before or after infection.

Therefore, the paper does not just identify a potential drug target (the interaction between RBD and ACE2) but also explores a potential therapeutic avenue (using a high-affinity RBD variant like RBD-62 to inhibit infection). They even present a 2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the high-affinity complex of RBD-62 and ACE2, which can serve as a guide for future drug and vaccine development, as well as for in silico evaluation of known antibodies.

Title: Drug-Repurposing Screening Identified Tropifexor as a SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like Protease Inhibitor
Keywords: GRL0617; PLpro; SARS-CoV-2; antiviral; papain-like protease; tropifexor.
Abstract: The global COVID-19 pandemic underscores the dire need for effective antivirals. Encouraging progress has been made in developing small-molecule inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease (Mpro). However, the development of papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors faces several obstacles. Nevertheless, PLpro represents a high-profile drug target given its multifaceted roles in viral replication. PLpro is involved in not only the cleavage of viral polyprotein but also the modulation of host immune response. In this study, we conducted a drug-repurposing screening of PLpro against the MedChemExpress bioactive compound library and identified three hits, EACC, KY-226, and tropifexor, as potent PLpro inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 3.39 to 8.28 Î¼M. The three hits showed dose-dependent binding to PLpro in the thermal shift assay. In addition, tropifexor inhibited the cellular PLpro activity in the FlipGFP assay with an IC50 of 10.6 Î¼M. Gratifyingly, tropifexor showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. Overall, tropifexor represents a novel PLpro inhibitor that can be further developed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.","The paper is focused on identifying potential antiviral agents against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through drug-repurposing screening. The drug target that the paper focuses on is the papain-like protease (PLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. PLpro is a part of the virus that is involved in viral replication and immune response modulation, making it a high-profile target for antiviral drug development.

In terms of experimental approach, the researchers used a drug-repurposing screening method against PLpro using the MedChemExpress bioactive compound library. They identified three compounds, EACC, KY-226, and tropifexor, as potential inhibitors of PLpro with IC50 values between 3.39 to 8.28 ?M. IC50 refers to the concentration of an inhibitor where the response or binding is reduced by half. Lower IC50 indicates a higher potency.

The researchers also conducted further assays including a thermal shift assay to demonstrate dose-dependent binding of these compounds to PLpro, and a FlipGFP assay to investigate the inhibition of cellular PLpro activity. Furthermore, they tested the antiviral activity of tropifexor against SARS-CoV-2 in a cellular model, Calu-3 cells, at noncytotoxic concentrations.

These types of experiments such as drug screening, thermal shift assays, cellular activity assays, and in vitro viral replication studies all constitute wet-lab approaches, meaning they are practical, hands-on experiments that involve manipulation of physical entities, such as compounds and cells, rather than purely theoretical or computational models.

Based on this reasoning,

Final Answer: Yes.

Title: Non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors developed from in silico screen hits
Abstract: Mpro, the main protease of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is essential for the viral life cycle. Accordingly, several groups have performed in silico screens to identify Mpro inhibitors that might be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. We selected more than five hundred compounds from the top-ranking hits of two very large in silico screens for on-demand synthesis. We then examined whether these compounds could bind to Mpro and inhibit its protease activity. Two interesting chemotypes were identified, which were further evaluated by characterizing an additional five hundred synthesis on-demand analogues. The compounds of the first chemotype denatured Mpro and were considered not useful for further development. The compounds of the second chemotype bound to and enhanced the melting temperature of Mpro. The most active compound from this chemotype inhibited Mpro in vitro with an IC50 value of 1 Î¼M and suppressed replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tissue culture cells. Its mode of binding to Mpro was determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing that it is a non-covalent inhibitor. We propose that the inhibitors described here could form the basis for medicinal chemistry efforts that could lead to the development of clinically relevant inhibitors.","The paper describes the development and testing of potential inhibitors of the Mpro, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. This protease is critical to the viral life cycle, which makes it a potential drug target. The authors initially used an in silico approach, or a computational model, to identify potential inhibitors. From there, they selected over five hundred compounds for on-demand synthesis, which is a wet-lab technique.

The synthesized compounds were then tested for their ability to bind to Mpro and inhibit its protease activity. This is again a wet-lab approach involving in vitro assays. Two chemotypes were identified as interesting, with further characterization done on five hundred synthesis on-demand analogues.

The first chemotype denatured Mpro and was not useful for further development. The second chemotype bound to Mpro, enhancing its melting temperature, and the most active compound was found to inhibit Mpro with an IC50 value of 1 ?M. It also suppressed SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in tissue culture cells, which is another wet-lab experiment.

Finally, the mode of binding of the most active compound to Mpro was determined by X-ray crystallography, a biophysical technique used in a wet-lab setting. Therefore, the paper identifies Mpro as a drug target and describes the wet-lab approach to developing potential inhibitors.

Title: SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Active Site Ligands in the Human Metabolome
Keywords: 3C-like protease; 3CL protease; COVID-19; Mpro; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; metabolome; protease inhibitors; silybin; silymarin.
Abstract: In late 2019, a global pandemic occurred. The causative agent was identified as a member of the Coronaviridae family, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we present an analysis on the substances identified in the human metabolome capable of binding the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The substances present in the human metabolome have both endogenous and exogenous origins. The aim of this research was to find molecules whose biochemical and toxicological profile was known that could be the starting point for the development of antiviral therapies. Our analysis revealed numerous metabolites-including xenobiotics-that bind this protease, which are essential to the lifecycle of the virus. Among these substances, silybin, a flavolignan compound and the main active component of silymarin, is particularly noteworthy. Silymarin is a standardized extract of milk thistle, Silybum marianum, and has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antineoplastic, and antiviral activities. Our results-obtained in silico and in vitro-prove that silybin and silymarin, respectively, are able to inhibit Mpro, representing a possible food-derived natural compound that is useful as a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.","The paper identifies the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) as a drug target, which is an essential component of the virus's lifecycle. However, the primary objective of the research does not seem to be the identification of this drug target, as Mpro is a well-known target for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Instead, the paper's main objective appears to be the identification of compounds within the human metabolome, both endogenous and exogenous, that could bind to and inhibit the Mpro.

The paper's approach involves in silico and in vitro methods. In silico methods often involve computer simulations or computational modeling to predict molecular interactions or behaviors, whereas in vitro methods refer to the testing of substances in a controlled environment, such as a test tube or a petri dish, outside of a living organism.

The substances identified as potential inhibitors of Mpro, particularly silybin and silymarin, are analyzed for their biochemical and toxicological profiles, which suggest a known safety profile in humans and therefore potential for use in therapies. The in vitro verification of these in silico findings can be considered a 'wet-lab' approach, as it involves physically conducting experiments to validate the computational predictions.

Final answer: Yes. The paper utilizes a wet-lab approach (in vitro studies) to validate the potential of identified compounds (silybin and silymarin) to inhibit an already known drug target (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro).",1,1,"{

Title: Discovery of SARS-CoV-2-E channel inhibitors as antiviral candidates
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; anti-virus; cation channel; envelope protein (2-E); high-throughput screening (HTS).
Abstract: Lack of efficiency has been a major problem shared by all currently developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. Our previous study shows that SARS-CoV-2 structural envelope (2-E) protein forms a type of cation channel, and heterogeneously expression of 2-E channels causes host cell death. In this study we developed a cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay and used it to discover inhibitors against 2-E channels. Among 4376 compounds tested, 34 hits with cell protection activity were found. Followed by an anti-viral analysis, 15 compounds which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication were identified. In electrophysiological experiments, three representatives showing inhibitory effect on 2-E channels were chosen for further characterization. Among them, proanthocyanidins directly bound to 2-E channel with binding affinity (KD) of 22.14 Î¼M in surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that proanthocyanidins inserted into the pore of 2-E N-terminal vestibule acting as a channel blocker. Consistently, mutations of Glu 8 and Asn 15, two residues lining the proposed binding pocket, abolished the inhibitory effects of proanthocyanidins. The natural product proanthocyanidins are widely used as cosmetic, suggesting a potential of proanthocyanidins as disinfectant for external use. This study further demonstrates that 2-E channel is an effective antiviral drug target and provides a potential antiviral candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","This paper does indeed identify an existing potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The potential drug target identified is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) envelope protein (2-E), which forms a type of cation channel. This cation channel is associated with host cell death and viral replication, making it an attractive target for drug intervention.

A cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay, which is a wet-lab technique, was used to screen 4376 compounds for inhibitory effects on 2-E channels. This yielded 34 compounds with cell protection activity, 15 of which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Three representative compounds were chosen for further characterization based on their inhibitory effects.

The researchers used electrophysiological experiments, which are also considered wet-lab methods, to characterize the activity of these compounds. They discovered that proanthocyanidins, one of the compounds, could bind to the 2-E channel with a binding affinity (KD) of 22.14 ?M, as measured in a surface plasmon resonance assay. This assay is a biophysical technique often used in drug discovery and protein interaction studies, indicating the use of a wet-lab approach.

Additionally, they used molecular modeling and docking analysis, techniques commonly employed in computational biology, to further understand the interaction between proanthocyanidins and the 2-E channel. However, the confirmation of these findings, in the form of mutational studies, is a wet-lab approach. The researchers mutated Glu 8 and Asn 15, two residues lining the proposed binding pocket, and observed that these mutations abolished the inhibitory effects of proanthocyanidins.

In conclusion, the paper identifies the SARS-CoV-2 2-E protein as a potential drug target and uses a variety of wet-lab techniques, such as high throughput screening, electrophysiological experiments, surface plasmon resonance assays, and mutational studies to support their conclusions.

Title: Two Binding Sites of SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain 3 Probed by Oxaprozin and Meclomen
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-1/2 (SARS-CoV-1/2) macrodomain 3 (Mac3) is critical for replication and transcription of the viral genome and is therefore a potential therapeutic target. Here, we solved the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac3, which reveals a small-molecule binding pocket. Two low-molecular-weight drugs, oxaprozin and meclomen, induced different patterns of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbations (CSPs). Meclomen binds to site I of SARS-CoV-2 Mac3 with binding pose determined by NMR CSP and transferred paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, while oxaprozin binds to site II as revealed by the crystal structure. Interestingly, oxaprozin and meclomen both perturb residues in site I of SARS-CoV Mac3. Fluorescence polarization experiments further demonstrated that oxaprozin and meclomen inhibited the binding of DNA-G4s to SARS-CoV-2 Mac3. Our work identified two adjacent ligand-binding sites of SARS-CoV-2 Mac3 that shall facilitate structure-guided fragment linking of these compounds for more potent inhibitors.","The paper titled ""Two Binding Sites of SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain 3 Probed by Oxaprozin and Meclomen"" describes a wet-lab approach to understanding the molecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain 3 (Mac3) and two low-molecular-weight drugs, oxaprozin and meclomen.

The methods described in the paper involve experimental approaches that fall under the definition of wet-lab techniques. Specifically, the authors used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine the different patterns of chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) induced by oxaprozin and meclomen, suggesting their binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Mac3. The binding sites were determined using NMR CSP and transferred paramagnetic relaxation enhancement for meclomen, and the crystal structure for oxaprozin. Fluorescence polarization experiments were also employed to show that these drugs inhibited the binding of DNA-G4s to the SARS-CoV-2 Mac3.

In the context of drug discovery, a drug target is a molecule in the body that is associated with a particular disease process, to which a drug binds, resulting in a therapeutic effect. In this case, the SARS-CoV-2 Mac3 is identified as crucial for the replication and transcription of the viral genome, suggesting its role in the progression of COVID-19. By demonstrating that these two drugs can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 Mac3, the paper identifies this macrodomain as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in COVID-19.

Thus, this paper identifies SARS-CoV-2 Mac3 as a potential drug target using wet-lab approaches including crystallography, NMR, and fluorescence polarization.

Title: NMR Observation of Sulfhydryl Signals in SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Aids Structural Studies

Abstract: The 68-kDa homodimeric 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, Mpro (3CLpro /Nsp5), is a key antiviral drug target. NMR spectroscopy of this large system proved challenging and resonance assignments have remained incomplete. Here we present the near-complete (>97 %) backbone assignments of a C145A variant of Mpro (Mpro C145A ) both with, and without, the N-terminal auto-cleavage substrate sequence, in its native homodimeric state. We also present SILLY (Selective Inversion of thioL and Ligand for NOESY), a simple yet effective pseudo-3D NMR experiment that utilizes NOEs to identify interactions between Cys-thiol or aliphatic protons, and their spatially proximate backbone amides in a perdeuterated protein background. High protection against hydrogen exchange is observed for 10 of the 11 thiol groups in Mpro C145A , even those that are partially accessible to solvent. A combination of SILLY methods and high-resolution triple-resonance NMR experiments reveals site-specific interactions between Mpro , its substrate peptides, and other ligands, which present opportunities for competitive binding studies in future drug design efforts.","The paper titled ""NMR Observation of Sulfhydryl Signals in SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Aids Structural Studies"" describes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic investigations of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro (also known as 3CLpro or Nsp5), which is described as a key antiviral drug target.

This protein has been recognized as a significant drug target because it plays an essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. Inhibition of this protein's function would prevent the virus from replicating and spreading, making it an attractive target for drug development.

The researchers performed wet-lab experiments using NMR spectroscopy to achieve near-complete (>97%) backbone assignments of a C145A variant of Mpro, in its native homodimeric state. This information is essential for understanding the structure and function of the protein, which can inform the design of potential drugs.

They have used these techniques to reveal site-specific interactions between Mpro, its substrate peptides, and other ligands. This information could be very valuable in guiding the design of competitive inhibitors (potential drugs) that could bind to the active site of the enzyme and inhibit its function.

They also provide structural information and reveal site-specific interactions which could guide future drug design efforts. Final Answer: Yes.",1,1,"{

Title: Two Ligand-Binding Sites on SARS-CoV-2 Non-Structural Protein 1 Revealed by Fragment-Based X-ray Screening
Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cross-binding effects; fragment-based X-ray screening; ligands; non-structural protein 1; structure-based drug design.
Abstract: The regular reappearance of coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks over the past 20 years has caused significant health consequences and financial burdens worldwide. The most recent and still ongoing novel CoV pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought a range of devastating consequences. Due to the exceptionally fast development of vaccines, the mortality rate of the virus has been curbed to a significant extent. However, the limitations of vaccination efficiency and applicability, coupled with the still high infection rate, emphasise the urgent need for discovering safe and effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing its replication or attenuating its virulence. Non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), a unique viral and conserved leader protein, is a crucial virulence factor for causing host mRNA degradation, suppressing interferon (IFN) expression and host antiviral signalling pathways. In view of the essential role of nsp1 in the CoV life cycle, it is regarded as an exploitable target for antiviral drug discovery. Here, we report a variety of fragment hits against the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 identified by fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography. We also determined the structure of nsp1 at atomic resolution (0.99 Ã). Binding affinities of hits against nsp1 and potential stabilisation were determined by orthogonal biophysical assays such as microscale thermophoresis and thermal shift assays. We identified two ligand-binding sites on nsp1, one deep and one shallow pocket, which are not conserved between the three medically relevant SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS coronaviruses. Our study provides an excellent starting point for the development of more potent nsp1-targeting inhibitors and functional studies on SARS-CoV-2 nsp1.","This paper identifies a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.

Furthermore, they identified two ligand-binding sites on nsp1, a deep pocket and a shallow pocket, providing potential specific targets for drug development. Importantly, these sites are not conserved between SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS coronaviruses, which means they might be unique to SARS-CoV-2.

Title: Eltrombopag is a potential target for drug intervention in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
Keywords: Homology Modeling; SARS-CoV-2; Surface plasmon resonance; Virtual drug design.
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a current global threat for which there is an urgent need to search for an effective therapy. The transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 directly binds to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediates viral entrance, which is therefore considered as a promising drug target. Considering that new drug development is a time-consuming process, drug repositioning may facilitate rapid drug discovery dealing with sudden infectious diseases. Here, we compared the differences between the virtual structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and selected a pocket mainly localizing in the fusion cores of S2 domain for drug screening. A virtual drug design algorithm screened the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library of 1234 compounds, and 13 top scored compounds were obtained through manual screening. Through in vitro molecular interaction experiments, eltrombopag was further verified to possess a high binding affinity to S protein plus human ACE2 and could potentially affect the stability of the ACE2-S protein complex. Hence, it is worth further exploring eltrombopag as a potential drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The paper titled ""Eltrombopag is a potential target for drug intervention in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"" discusses the use of a virtual drug design algorithm to identify potential drugs from an FDA-approved library of compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which binds to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediates viral entry, was used as the target for this drug screening.

In this process, the researchers selected a pocket in the fusion cores of the S2 domain of the S glycoprotein as the target for drug screening. The virtual drug design algorithm was then used to screen an FDA-approved library of 1234 compounds. This process resulted in 13 top-scored compounds, among which eltrombopag was found to have a high binding affinity to the S protein plus human ACE2.

The researchers went further to validate these findings using wet-lab methods. Specifically, in vitro molecular interaction experiments were conducted to confirm that eltrombopag indeed has a high binding affinity to the S protein and ACE2 and could potentially affect the stability of the ACE2-S protein complex.

This suggests that the paper identified an existing drug (eltrombopag) with potential therapeutic effects on SARS-CoV-2, using a combination of computational (virtual drug design algorithm) and wet-lab (in vitro molecular interaction experiments) approaches.

So, while the initial drug target identification was done using a computational approach, the validation of the drug-target interaction was conducted using a wet-lab approach.

Abstract: Two proteases produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the main protease and papain-like protease, are essential for viral replication and have become the focus of drug development programs for treatment of COVID-19. We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both Mpro and PLpro proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the Mpro protease and no viable hits for the PLpro protease. Of the Mpro hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead Mpro inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of Mpro inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsins L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Our results highlight the challenges of targeting Mpro and PLpro proteases and demonstrate the need to carefully assess selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to prevent clinical advancement of compounds that function through inhibition of a redundant viral entry pathway.","The paper indeed identifies potential drug targets, which are the main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These proteases are key for viral replication and are therefore viable targets for therapeutic intervention. The researchers screened a library of compounds designed to target cysteine proteases in order to identify new lead scaffolds for both Mpro and PLpro proteases. This process involved a wet-lab approach as it necessitated the physical screening of compounds against these proteins.

However, the success of identifying viable drug targets was mixed. For the Mpro protease, a small number of hits were identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, and only two of these compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. For the PLpro protease, the paper reports no viable hits. Moreover, the potency of the Mpro inhibitors was observed to decrease in the presence of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway. This was because the lead Mpro inhibitors also potently inhibited host cell cysteine cathepsins, demonstrating the difficulties associated with targeting these proteases.

While the paper did not identify a fully effective and selective drug target, it does provide valuable insights into the challenges of targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteases and the need to assess the selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors.

However, the identified potential targets face challenges regarding their selectivity and efficacy. Final Answer: Yes, this paper does identify potential drug targets using a wet-lab approach. ",1,1,"{

Title: Host chitinase 3-like-1 is a universal therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 viral variants in COVID-19
Keywords: CHI3L1; FRG; anti-CHI3L1 antibody; delta; infectious disease; kasugamycin; microbiology; omicron; viruses.
Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; SC2), which has caused a worldwide pandemic with striking morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of SC2 strains demonstrated impressive genetic variability, and many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics, and/or the ability to induce severe disease. Currently, the delta (Î´) and omicron (Î¿) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause breakthrough infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and Spike (S) priming proteases that mediate SC2 infection, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here, we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. Thus, CHI3L1 is a universal, VOC-independent therapeutic target in COVID-19.","The paper identifies chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) as a universal therapeutic target in COVID-19. The study reveals that CHI3L1 stimulates ACE2 and Spike (S) priming proteases that mediate SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) infection, and hence it has a crucial role in the infection process of SARS-CoV-2.

The researchers used a wet-lab approach to validate this. They demonstrated that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express different S proteins, including those from various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), namely alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron. These pseudoviruses are lab-made viruses that can mimic the function of the actual virus without causing the disease, which are commonly used in wet-lab research for testing purposes.

They also tested the ability of CHI3L1 inhibitors, specifically anti-CHI3L1 antibody and kasugamycin, to inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. The results showed that these inhibitors effectively limited the infection, demonstrating that CHI3L1 is indeed a potential drug target for treating COVID-19. The investigation of CHI3L1 and its inhibitors in this context suggests the use of wet-lab techniques, likely including in vitro assays, to demonstrate the role of CHI3L1 and the efficacy of its inhibitors.

Therefore, the paper identifies CHI3L1 as a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Engineering defensin Î±-helix to produce high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding ligands
Keywords: ACE2; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics; defensin; spike-protein.
Abstract: The binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the host cells is a critical initial step for viral infection. This interaction is blocked through competitive inhibition by soluble ACE2 protein. Therefore, developing high-affinity and cost-effective ACE2 mimetic ligands that disrupt this protein-protein interaction is a promising strategy for viral diagnostics and therapy. We employed human and plant defensins, a class of small (2-5 kDa) and highly stable proteins containing solvent-exposed alpha-helix, conformationally constrained by two disulfide bonds. Therefore, we engineered the amino acid residues on the constrained alpha-helix of defensins to mimic the critical residues on the ACE2 helix 1 that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The engineered proteins (h-deface2, p-deface2, and p-deface2-MUT) were soluble and purified to homogeneity with a high yield from a bacterial expression system. The proteins demonstrated exceptional thermostability (Tm 70.7Â°C), high-affinity binding to the spike protein with apparent Kd values of 54.4 Â± 11.3, 33.5 Â± 8.2, and 14.4 Â± 3.5 nM for h-deface2, p-deface2, and p-deface2-MUT, respectively, and were used in a diagnostic assay that detected SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. This work addresses the challenge of developing helical ACE2 mimetics by demonstrating that defensins provide promising scaffolds to engineer alpha-helices in a constrained form for designing of high-affinity ligands.","This paper describes a wet-lab approach that involves engineering small and highly stable proteins, known as defensins, to mimic the critical residues on the ACE2 helix 1 that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This is essentially a strategy to create high-affinity and cost-effective ACE2 mimetic ligands that could disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 receptor, a process that is crucial for the virus to infect host cells.

These engineered defensins (h-deface2, p-deface2, and p-deface2-MUT) were found to have high-affinity binding to the spike protein, as indicated by their low apparent Kd values, and they demonstrated exceptional thermostability. Moreover, these engineered proteins were used in a diagnostic assay that detected SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that they could have potential applications in diagnostics and possibly therapeutics.

In the context of the question, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is an established target for COVID-19 because it plays a critical role in the viral infection process. This interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor is considered a drug target because interrupting it can prevent the virus from entering host cells. The paper doesn't explicitly mention a new drug target; rather, it investigates a new approach to target the already established drug target, which is the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor.

Therefore, the paper does identify a way to potentially disrupt an existing drug target (the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's interaction with the ACE2 receptor) using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Folic acid: a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
Keywords: COVID-19; Chinese medicine; antivirus; network pharmacology.
Abstract: Context: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a global pandemic. Studies suggest that folic acid has antiviral effects. Molecular docking shown that folic acid can act on SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 N). Objective: To identify novel molecular therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods: Traditional Chinese medicine targets and virus-related genes were identified with network pharmacology and big data analysis. Folic acid was singled out by molecular docking, and its potential target SARS-CoV-2 N was identified. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 N of folic acid was verified at the cellular level. Results: In total, 8355 drug targets were potentially involved in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. 113 hub genes were screened by further association analysis between targets and virus-related genes. The hub genes related compounds were analysed and folic acid was screened as a potential new drug. Moreover, molecular docking showed folic acid could target on SARS-CoV-2 N which inhibits host RNA interference (RNAi). Therefore, this study was based on RNAi to verify whether folic acid antagonises SARS-CoV-2 N. Cell-based experiments shown that RNAi decreased mCherry expression by 81.7% (p < 0.001). This effect was decreased by 8.0% in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 N inhibits RNAi. With increasing of folic acid concentration, mCherry expression decreased, indicating that folic acid antagonises the regulatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 N on host RNAi. Discussion and conclusions: Folic acid may be an antagonist of SARS-CoV-2 N, but its effect on viruses unclear. In future, the mechanisms of action of folic acid against SARS-CoV-2 N should be studied.","In this paper, the authors identify a potential drug target for SARS-CoV-2, which is the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 N). They used a combination of techniques including network pharmacology, big data analysis, and molecular docking to identify this target. Molecular docking is a computational method that predicts the orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to form a stable complex. It is often used in drug discovery to predict the binding affinity of a small molecule drug candidate to its protein target.

Once they identified folic acid as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 N, the authors then validated this hypothesis with wet-lab experiments at the cellular level. In particular, they used a cell-based experiment to verify whether folic acid antagonizes SARS-CoV-2 N. Their data showed that SARS-CoV-2 N inhibits RNA interference (RNAi), a host defense mechanism, and that the presence of folic acid appears to antagonize this inhibition.

Final answer: Yes, this paper does identify a potential drug target for SARS-CoV-2 and validates it using a wet-lab approach.",1,1,"{

Title: Identification of Darunavir Derivatives for Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
Keywords: 3CLpro; anti-coronavirus drug; protease; screening assay; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
Abstract: The effective antiviral agents that treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed around the world. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in virus replication; it also has become an important therapeutic target for the infection of SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we have identified Darunavir derivatives that inhibit the 3CLpro through a high-throughput screening method based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay in vitro. We found that the compounds 29# and 50# containing polyphenol and caffeine derivatives as the P2 ligand, respectively, exhibited favorable anti-3CLpro potency with EC50 values of 6.3 Î¼M and 3.5 Î¼M and were shown to bind to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in vitro. Moreover, we analyzed the binding mode of the DRV in the 3CLpro through molecular docking. Importantly, 29# and 50# exhibited a similar activity against the protease in Omicron variants. The inhibitory effect of compounds 29# and 50# on the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro warrants that they are worth being the template to design functionally improved inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19.","The paper titled ""Identification of Darunavir Derivatives for Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro"" identifies a potential drug target, namely the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2, and seeks to interfere with its function using derivatives of the drug Darunavir.

The 3CLpro is a protease, which means it is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of proteins. This particular protease plays a significant role in the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and thus inhibiting its activity could potentially halt or slow down the virus' ability to multiply and spread.

The researchers conducted their investigation by employing a high-throughput screening method that utilized a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, an in vitro (test tube) technique. This method allowed them to identify and examine compounds that could inhibit the function of the 3CLpro enzyme. They identified two specific Darunavir derivatives, named 29# and 50#, which were found to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, demonstrating anti-3CLpro potency with EC50 values of 6.3 ?M and 3.5 ?M, respectively.

Molecular docking was also performed to analyze the binding mode of Darunavir in the 3CLpro, which further provides insight into how these molecules interact and potentially inhibit the function of the enzyme.

The paper's methods fit the description of a wet-lab approach because they involved physically conducting non-computational experiments (the FRET assay and molecular docking) in a laboratory setting. Therefore, the researchers used a wet-lab approach to identify a potential drug target (3CLpro) and evaluate the effectiveness of certain compounds (29# and 50#) at binding to and potentially inhibiting this target.

Title: Full-Length Recombinant hSP-D Binds and Inhibits SARS-CoV-2
Keywords: ACE2; COVID-19; SP-D; anti-inflammatory; spike-protein.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells is driven by binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-(S)-protein to lung type II pneumocytes, followed by virus replication. Surfactant protein SP-D, member of the front-line immune defense of the lungs, binds glycosylated structures on invading pathogens such as viruses to induce their clearance from the lungs. The objective of this study is to measure the pulmonary SP-D levels in COVID-19 patients and demonstrate the activity of SP-D against SARS-CoV-2, opening the possibility of using SP-D as potential therapy for COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary SP-D concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by anti-SP-D ELISA. Binding assays were performed by ELISAs. Protein bridge and aggregation assays were performed by gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and band densitometry. Viral replication was evaluated in vitro using epithelial Caco-2 cells. Results indicate that COVID-19 patients (n = 12) show decreased pulmonary levels of SP-D (median = 68.9 ng/mL) when compared to levels reported for healthy controls in literature. Binding assays demonstrate that SP-D binds the SARS-CoV-2 glycosylated spike-(S)-protein of different emerging clinical variants. Binding induces the formation of protein bridges, the critical step of viral aggregation to facilitate its clearance. SP-D inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 cells (EC90 = 3.7 Î¼g/mL). Therefore, SP-D recognizes and binds to the spike-(S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, initiates the aggregation, and inhibits viral replication in cells. Combined with the low levels of SP-D observed in COVID-19 patients, these results suggest that SP-D is important in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and that rhSP-D supplementation has the potential to be a novel class of anti-viral that will target SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The paper under discussion focuses on the protein SP-D (surfactant protein-D), which is a component of the immune defense of the lungs. SP-D binds to glycosylated structures on pathogens such as viruses to initiate their clearance from the lungs. In this study, the authors have used a variety of wet-lab techniques to investigate the role of SP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The researchers measured SP-D concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with COVID-19 using an anti-SP-D ELISA, a wet-lab technique. This was to quantify the levels of SP-D in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. They found that COVID-19 patients had decreased pulmonary levels of SP-D compared to healthy controls.

The authors also used binding assays to demonstrate that SP-D binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the key molecule the virus uses to infect host cells. The binding induces the formation of protein bridges, leading to the aggregation of the virus, which is a critical step for its clearance. This aggregation and clearance were further confirmed by gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and band densitometry.

Furthermore, the authors showed that SP-D inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in epithelial Caco-2 cells, which is an example of an in vitro study.

Based on these results, they suggest that supplementing with recombinant human SP-D (rhSP-D) might have the potential to be a novel class of anti-viral that targets SARS-CoV-2 infection, implying that SP-D is a potential therapeutic target.

In summary, this paper investigates SP-D as a potential target for therapeutic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 infection using a range of wet-lab techniques.

Title: Structures and therapeutic potential of anti-RBD human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
Keywords: Antibody cocktail; Antibody-antigen complex; Human monoclonal antibody; In vitro and in vivo function; Receptor-binding domain epitope; SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Background: Administration of potent anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies has been shown to curtail viral shedding and reduce hospitalization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the structure-function analysis of potent human anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies and its links to the formulation of antibody cocktails remains largely elusive. Methods: Previously, we isolated a panel of neutralizing anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients and showed their neutralization efficacy in vitro. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of action of antibodies and dissect antibodies at the epitope level, which leads to a formation of a potent antibody cocktail. Results: We found that representative antibodies which target non-overlapping epitopes are effective against wild type virus and recently emerging variants of concern, whilst being encoded by antibody genes with few somatic mutations. Neutralization is associated with the inhibition of binding of viral RBD to ACE2 and possibly of the subsequent fusion process. Structural analysis of representative antibodies, by cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography, reveals that they have some unique aspects that are of potential value while sharing some features in common with previously reported neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. For instance, one has a common VH 3-53 public variable region yet is unusually resilient to mutation at residue 501 of the RBD. We evaluate the in vivo efficacy of an antibody cocktail consisting of two potent non-competing anti-RBD antibodies in a Syrian hamster model. We demonstrate that the cocktail prevents weight loss, reduces lung viral load and attenuates pulmonary inflammation in hamsters in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Although neutralization of one of these antibodies is abrogated by the mutations of variant B.1.351, it is also possible to produce a bi-valent cocktail of antibodies both of which are resilient to variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. Conclusions: These findings support the up-to-date and rational design of an anti-RBD antibody cocktail as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19.","The paper discusses the development and potential therapeutic use of an anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain is part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which the virus uses to bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells and initiate infection. Therefore, the RBD is a potential drug target, and the use of antibodies that can bind to it and prevent it from interacting with the ACE2 receptor is a therapeutic strategy.

The authors isolate a panel of neutralizing anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients and conduct in vitro studies to demonstrate their neutralizing efficacy. They analyze the structure-function relationship of these antibodies, discover how they bind to the RBD, and assess their effectiveness against various virus variants. They also conduct in vivo studies in a Syrian hamster model to evaluate the efficacy of an antibody cocktail composed of two potent non-competing anti-RBD antibodies. These in vivo studies demonstrate the cocktail's ability to prevent weight loss, reduce lung viral load, and attenuate pulmonary inflammation in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings.

The techniques used in this study, including in vitro assays of binding and neutralization, in vivo studies in Syrian hamsters, and structural determination of binding by cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography, are wet-lab approaches. Therefore, the paper uses a wet-lab approach to investigate the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a potential drug target and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies directed against this target.

Title: Human Cathelicidin Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Killing Two Birds with One Stone
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; cathelicidin; receptor binding domain; spike.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the association of its spike 1 (S1) protein with host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 Î¼g/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection. The study identified a versatile antimicrobial peptide in humans as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment using dual mechanisms, thus providing a potential candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and treatment.","This paper investigates the use of human cathelicidin LL37 as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection by way of blocking the binding interaction between the virus's spike protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). This blocking action is mediated through two proposed mechanisms: 1) LL37 binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which effectively inhibits the virus's ability to connect to the host cell; 2) LL37 binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ACE2, effectively 'cloaking' the host's cells from viral adherence and consequent infection.

The paper describes a series of experiments that validate these mechanisms. These experiments were conducted in vitro (thereby classifying them as wet-lab approaches), measuring binding affinities and the ability of LL37 to inhibit pseudovirion infection. Additionally, in vivo studies were performed involving intranasal administration of LL37 in mice expressing human ACE2, assessing the potential therapeutic action of LL37 in reducing lung infection.

It is important to note that LL37 is not a new drug target but an existing antimicrobial peptide in humans. The paper, however, demonstrates a novel utilization of this peptide as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, making LL37 an attractive therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Viral exoribonucleases are uncommon in the world of RNA viruses. To date, they have only been identified in the Arenaviridae and the Coronaviridae families. The exoribonucleases of these viruses play a crucial role in the pathogenicity and interplay with host innate immune response. Moreover, coronaviruses exoribonuclease is also involved in a proofreading mechanism ensuring the genetic stability of the viral genome. Because of their key roles in virus life cycle, they constitute attractive target for drug design. Here we developed a sensitive, robust and reliable fluorescence polarization assay to measure the exoribonuclease activity and its inhibition in vitro. The effectiveness of the method was validated on three different viral exoribonucleases, including SARS-CoV-2, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis and Machupo viruses. We performed a screening of a focused library consisting of 113 metal chelators. Hit compounds were recovered with an IC50 at micromolar level. We confirmed 3 hits in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero-E6 cells.","This paper indeed employs a wet-lab approach to identify a potential drug target. The wet-lab approach here is represented by the usage of a fluorescence polarization assay. The assay is an experimental procedure that allows for the measurement of exoribonuclease activity, and its inhibition, in vitro. The paper identifies viral exoribonucleases from Arenaviridae and Coronaviridae families, including SARS-CoV-2, as potential drug targets. The identified targets are considered key players in the virus lifecycle and contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus and its interaction with the host immune response.

The authors have further applied their assay to a focused library of 113 metal chelators. This process, often termed high-throughput screening, is designed to find molecules that can inhibit the activity of the identified targets. From the library, they found hit compounds (potential inhibitors) that showed effectiveness at the micromolar level. These potential inhibitors, if further validated and developed, can function as drugs against the identified targets. The hits were confirmed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero-E6 cells, which again is part of the wet-lab approach.

In summary, the paper uses a wet-lab methodology (fluorescence polarization assay) to study the activity of viral exoribonucleases, identifying them as potential drug targets. Furthermore, it uses this same assay to screen for potential inhibitor compounds that could be developed into therapeutic drugs.

Title: Ubiquitin variants potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and viral replication via a novel site distal to the protease active site
Abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has made it clear that combating coronavirus outbreaks benefits from a combination of vaccines and therapeutics. A promising drug target common to all coronaviruses-including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2-is the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro cleaves part of the viral replicase polyproteins into non-structural protein subunits, which are essential to the viral replication cycle. Additionally, PLpro can cleave both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 from host cell substrates as a mechanism to evade innate immune responses during infection. These roles make PLpro an attractive antiviral drug target. Here we demonstrate that ubiquitin variants (UbVs) can be selected from a phage-displayed library and used to specifically and potently block SARS-CoV-2 PLpro activity. A crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with a representative UbV reveals a dimeric UbV bound to PLpro at a site distal to the catalytic site. Yet, the UbV inhibits the essential cleavage activities of the protease in vitro and in cells, and it reduces viral replication in cell culture by almost five orders of magnitude.","This paper focuses on the papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential drug target.

This protein is a part of the viral replicase polyproteins and has a crucial role in the virus's replication cycle as it cleaves these polyproteins into non-structural protein subunits. Additionally, PLpro can cleave both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 from host cell substrates, thereby enabling the virus to evade innate immune responses during infection. These significant roles in the viral life cycle make PLpro an attractive drug target.

The researchers used a wet-lab approach in their investigation. They selected ubiquitin variants (UbVs) from a phage-displayed library and demonstrated that these UbVs could specifically and potently block SARS-CoV-2 PLpro activity. Furthermore, a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in complex with a representative UbV revealed that the UbV binds to PLpro at a site distal to the catalytic site. This UbV was found to inhibit the essential cleavage activities of the protease in vitro (a wet-lab method) and in cells. Moreover, the UbV reduced viral replication in cell culture (also a wet-lab method) by almost five orders of magnitude.

Based on these findings, it appears that the researchers have identified a potential drug target (PLpro) for SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated a possible method of inhibition using UbVs. They conducted these experiments using wet-lab techniques, including in vitro assays and cell culture studies, thus combining molecular binding studies with an investigation of an actual or potential drug target.

Title: Methotrexate inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry, infection and inflammation revealed by bioinformatics approach and a hamster model
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; drug repurposing; inflammation; methotrexate; multi-target drugs.
Abstract: Background: Drug repurposing is a fast and effective way to develop drugs for an emerging disease such as COVID-19. The main challenges of effective drug repurposing are the discoveries of the right therapeutic targets and the right drugs for combating the disease. Methods: Here, we present a systematic repurposing approach, combining Homopharma and hierarchal systems biology networks (HiSBiN), to predict 327 therapeutic targets and 21,233 drug-target interactions of 1,592 FDA drugs for COVID-19. Among these multi-target drugs, eight candidates (along with pimozide and valsartan) were tested and methotrexate was identified to affect 14 therapeutic targets suppressing SARS-CoV-2 entry, viral replication, and COVID-19 pathologies. Through the use of in vitro (EC50 = 0.4 Î¼M) and in vivo models, we show that methotrexate is able to inhibit COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms. Results: Our in vitro studies illustrate that methotrexate can suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication by targeting furin and DHFR of the host, respectively. Additionally, methotrexate inhibits all four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In a Syrian hamster model for COVID-19, methotrexate reduced virus replication, inflammation in the infected lungs. By analysis of transcriptomic analysis of collected samples from hamster lung, we uncovered that neutrophil infiltration and the pathways of innate immune response, adaptive immune response and thrombosis are modulated in the treated animals. Conclusions: We demonstrate that this systematic repurposing approach is potentially useful to identify pharmaceutical targets, multi-target drugs and regulated pathways for a complex disease. Our findings indicate that methotrexate is established as a promising drug against SARS-CoV-2 variants and can be used to treat lung damage and inflammation in COVID-19, warranting future evaluation in clinical trials.","The paper does indeed identify an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach. According to the paper, the researchers used both in vitro and in vivo models to validate the effectiveness of methotrexate against SARS-CoV-2. Methotrexate is an existing drug used primarily in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. In this study, the drug was identified through a bioinformatics approach, which suggested its potential against SARS-CoV-2 due to its multi-target nature. The in vitro (EC50 = 0.4 ?M) and in vivo tests were then conducted to experimentally validate the computational predictions. The in vitro studies demonstrated that methotrexate can suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication by targeting furin and DHFR of the host. Furthermore, methotrexate was tested in a Syrian hamster model for COVID-19 where it reduced virus replication and inflammation in the infected lungs.

Thus, the paper uses a wet-lab approach to validate and characterize the action of an existing drug, methotrexate, against specific targets, notably furin and DHFR, in the SARS-CoV-2 infection process.

Title: Merbromin is a mixed-type inhibitor of 3-chyomotrypsin like protease of SARS-CoV-2
Keywords: 3CLpro; High-throughput screening; Inhibitor; Merbromin; Protease; SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: 3-chyomotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) has been considered as a promising target for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Herein, about 6000 compounds were analyzed by high-throughput screening using enzyme activity model, and Merbromin, an antibacterial agent, was identified as a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro. Merbromin strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro but not the other three proteases Proteinase K, Trypsin and Papain. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis showed that Merbromin was a mixed-type inhibitor of 3CLpro, due to its ability of increasing the KM and decreasing the Kcat of 3CLpro. The binding assays and molecular docking suggested that 3CLpro possessed two binding sites for Merbromin. Consistently, Merbromin showed a weak binding to the other three proteases. Together, these findings demonstrated that Merbromin is a selective inhibitor of 3CLpro and provided a scaffold to design effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","This paper indeed uses a wet-lab approach to identify a potential drug target for SARS-CoV-2. The potential target here is the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2.

Wet-lab approaches involve conducting physical experiments, typically in a laboratory setting, using non-computational methods. In this case, the authors used high-throughput screening (a method commonly used in drug discovery) to analyze around 6000 compounds for their ability to inhibit 3CLpro. This technique involves conducting a series of biochemical, genetic or pharmacological tests on different compounds in order to identify those that are active against a selected target. High-throughput screening is a classic wet-lab technique, in which thousands of compounds can be tested at the same time using automated methods.

The compound found to be a potent inhibitor of 3CLpro was Merbromin, an antibacterial agent. They confirmed this finding using enzyme activity models (wet-lab assays) and Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis (a mathematical model used in enzymology).

Further, they performed binding assays, another wet-lab approach, and found that Merbromin binds to two sites on the 3CLpro molecule. They also compared its binding strength and specificity to other proteases, demonstrating its selectivity towards 3CLpro.

In summary, the paper uses a wet-lab approach (high-throughput screening, enzyme activity assays, kinetic analysis, and binding assays) to identify 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential drug target and Merbromin as a selective inhibitor of 3CLpro.

Title: Integrin activation is an essential component of SARS-CoV-2 infection
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on binding its spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein expresses an RGD motif, suggesting that integrins may be co-receptors. Here, we UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and fluorescently labeled the envelope membrane with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) to explore the role of integrin activation in mediating cell entry and productive infection. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to show that SARS-CoV-2R18 particles engage basal-state integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mn2+, which induces integrin extension, enhances cell entry of SARS-CoV-2R18. We also show that one class of integrin antagonist, which binds to the Î±I MIDAS site and stabilizes the inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2R18 with basal state integrins, but is ineffective against Mn2+-activated integrins. RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2R18 binding regardless of integrin activation status. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally: 'inside-out' signaling primes the ligand-binding function of integrins via a talin-dependent mechanism, and 'outside-in' signaling occurs downstream of integrin binding to macromolecular ligands. Outside-in signaling is mediated by GÎ±13. Using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin and GÎ±13 binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrin's Î² subunit, we demonstrate that talin-mediated signaling is essential for productive infection.","The paper does seem to identify a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The researchers investigated the role of integrins, a type of protein on the surface of cells, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, they focused on the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 which contains an RGD motif, a sequence of amino acids known to bind to integrins. Integrins are generally involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction, and their dysregulation has been implicated in various disease processes.

The wet-lab approach was utilized in several ways. Firstly, the researchers used ultraviolet (UV) light to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus and labeled the viral envelope with a fluorescent molecule (octadecyl rhodamine B, or R18). They then examined the interaction between this labeled virus (SARS-CoV-2R18) and basal-state integrins using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, both of which are wet-lab techniques. Their results showed that SARS-CoV-2R18 particles engage with these integrins.

Further experimentation showed that manganese ions (Mn2+), which induce integrin activation and extension, enhance the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2R18. On the other hand, an integrin antagonist, which binds to the ?I MIDAS site on the integrin and stabilizes it in an inactive, closed conformation, selectively inhibits the engagement of SARS-CoV-2R18 with basal state integrins but is ineffective against Mn2+-activated integrins. Another class of RGD-integrin antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2R18 binding regardless of integrin activation status.

Finally, the authors identified a key intracellular signaling mechanism for integrins, talin-mediated signaling, as essential for productive SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was done by using cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of talin and G?13 binding to the cytoplasmic tail of an integrin's ? subunit.

So, in essence, the paper identifies integrins as a potential drug target. More specifically, it indicates that inhibiting integrin activation or interfering with the integrin-mediated signaling process might represent a promising strategy for developing treatments against SARS-CoV-2.

Title: RNA sequence and ligand binding alter conformational profile of SARS-CoV-2 stem loop II motif
Keywords: COVID-19; Molecular dynamics; RNA-targeted drug discovery; S2M; SARS-CoV-2; Stem-loop II motif.
Abstract: Antiviral drug discovery continues to be an essential complement to vaccine development for overcoming the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis making them potential therapeutic targets. Here we report on the stem-loop II motif, a highly conserved noncoding RNA element. Based on our homology model we determined that the G to U transversion in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif (S2MG35U) forms a C-U base-pair isosteric to the C-G base-pair in the early 2000's SARS-CoV (S2M). In addition, chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S2MG35U conformational profile is altered compared to S2M in the apical loop region. We explored S2MG35U as a potential drug target by docking a library of FDA approved drugs. Enzymatic probing of the best docking ligands (aminoglycosides and polymyxins) indicated that polymyxin binding alters the conformational profile and/or secondary structure of the RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif conformational differences due to nucleotide transversion and ligand binding are highly significant and provide insight for future drug discovery efforts since the conformation of noncoding RNA elements affects their function.","This paper investigates the conformational profile and potential as a drug target of the stem-loop II motif, a noncoding RNA element of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the causative agent of COVID-19. It mentions that the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 contains structural elements that are important for viral replication and/or pathogenesis, implying these could be potential drug targets.

The study utilized a combination of techniques. It used homology modeling to determine that a specific mutation (G to U transversion) in the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif forms a base pair isosteric to a base pair in the SARS-CoV virus. Additionally, it applied chemo-enzymatic probing and molecular dynamics simulations to study the changes in the conformational profile of the motif caused by this mutation.

Next, the researchers used computational techniques (docking) to predict the binding of a library of FDA-approved drugs to this motif. This docking procedure is a dry-lab or in silico approach as it uses computer algorithms to predict the interaction of the drug with the target.

However, to confirm the predictions from the docking studies, they performed enzymatic probing of the best-docking ligands. Enzymatic probing is a wet-lab technique that allows researchers to investigate changes in the structure of the RNA motif due to drug binding. This experiment is a physical procedure carried out in a lab with real substances (RNA and ligands).

It's important to note that while the paper identifies a potential drug target (the S2MG35U version of the stem-loop II motif), it does not report the testing of any drug on a biological system (such as cell cultures or animal models).

Final Answer: Yes.

This paper identifies the SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif as a potential drug target and uses a wet-lab approach (enzymatic probing) to confirm the predictions from in silico drug docking studies.",1,1,"{""drug_targets"": [""SARS-CoV-2 stem-loop II motif""]}",10

Title: Targeting SARS-CoV-2 M3CLpro by HCV NS3/4a Inhibitors: In Silico Modeling and In Vitro Screening
Abstract: Currently the entire human population is in the midst of a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This highly pathogenic virus has to date caused >71 million infections and >1.6 million deaths in >180 countries. Several vaccines and drugs are being studied as possible treatments or prophylactics of this viral infection. M3CLpro (coronavirus main cysteine protease) is a promising drug target as it has a significant role in viral replication. Here we use the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study the dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding. The binding free energy was calculated for water molecules at different locations of the binding site, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for the M3CLpro/boceprevir complex, to thoroughly understand the chemical environment of the binding site. Several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors were tested in vitro against M3CLpro. Specifically, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro. Molecular docking and MD simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of these ligands on M3CLpro and to provide insights into the chemical environment of the ligand binding site. Our findings and observations are offered to help guide the design of possible potent protease inhibitors and aid in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.","The paper identifies the main cysteine protease (M3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as a promising drug target. M3CLpro is crucial for viral replication, making it a potentially effective site to disrupt with drug treatments to halt the spread of the virus. The approach described in the paper involves both in silico and in vitro methodologies.

The in silico approach, or computational modeling, includes the use of the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and molecular docking. This modeling helps understand the chemical environment of the binding site and provides insights into the effects of different ligands on M3CLpro.

On the other hand, the wet-lab approach is represented by the in vitro screening of several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors against M3CLpro. The in vitro assays are types of wet-lab experiments because they involve physically testing the interactions of the potential drugs with the target molecule. These inhibitors include asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir, which all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro.

Title: Gossypol Broadly Inhibits Coronaviruses by Targeting RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases
Keywords: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; gossypol; natural product.
Abstract: Outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have posed serious threats to humans and animals, which urgently calls for effective broad-spectrum antivirals. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays an essential role in viral RNA synthesis and is an ideal pan-coronaviral therapeutic target. Herein, based on cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, gossypol (GOS) is identified from 881 natural products to directly block SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, thus inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in both cellular and mouse infection models. GOS also acts as a potent inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) and exerts same inhibitory effects toward mutated RdRps of VOCs as the RdRp of the original SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, that the RdRp inhibitor GOS has broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity against alphacoronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus), betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), gammacoronaviruses (avian infectious bronchitis virus), and deltacoronaviruses (porcine deltacoronavirus) is showed. The findings demonstrate that GOS may serve as a promising lead compound for combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other coronavirus outbreaks.","This paper identifies RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a key target of the natural product gossypol (GOS) in its role of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

The researchers utilize both cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical methods, which are wet-lab approaches, to identify that gossypol directly blocks SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, thus inhibiting viral replication in cellular and mouse infection models. In addition, the paper shows that gossypol can act as a potent inhibitor against various variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other types of coronaviruses (alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and deltacoronaviruses).

Title: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates CREB/CBP in cellular cyclic AMP-dependent pathways
Keywords: CREB/CBP; SARS-CoV-2; cAMP-PKA; nAS-E.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has affected the lives of billions of individuals. However, the host-virus interactions still need further investigation to reveal the underling mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, transcriptomics analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted possible correlation between host-associated signaling pathway and virus. In detail, cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) pathway has an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by the interaction between cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) could be induced and leading to the enhancement of CREB/CBP transcriptional activity. The replication of Delta and Omicron BA.5 were inhibited by about 49.4% and 44.7% after knockdown of CREB and CBP with small interfering RNAs, respectively. Furthermore, a small organic molecule naphthol AS-E (nAS-E), which targets on the interaction between CREB and CBP, potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) infection with comparable the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) 1.04 Î¼M to Remdesivir 0.57 Î¼M. Compared with WT virus, EC50 in Calu-3 cells against Delta, Omicron BA.2, and Omicron BA.5 were, on average, 1.5-fold, 1.1-fold, and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, nAS-E had a satisfied antiviral effect against Omicron variants. Taken together, our study demonstrated the importance of CREB/CBP induced by cAMP-PKA pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further provided a novel CREB/CBP interaction therapeutic drug targets for COVID-19.","This paper identifies an existing molecular interaction that can potentially be used as a drug target through a wet-lab approach. The paper focuses on the role of the cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically highlighting the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) interaction. According to the paper, the infection enhances the transcriptional activity of the CREB/CBP interaction, suggesting a possible therapeutic intervention point.

The authors used a wet-lab approach to confirm this hypothesis, first using transcriptomics analysis to correlate the host-associated signaling pathway with the virus. They then employed RNA interference (RNAi), a widely used wet-lab technique, to knock down the CREB and CBP genes. This led to a decrease in the replication of two SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta and Omicron BA.5), providing experimental evidence that the CREB/CBP interaction could indeed be a potential target for inhibiting the virus.

Further, they tested the effect of a small organic molecule naphthol AS-E (nAS-E), which targets the interaction between CREB and CBP. The molecule demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab, which further supports the possibility of the CREB/CBP interaction being a therapeutic target. The researchers showed the EC50 value of nAS-E was comparable to Remdesivir, a known antiviral drug used for COVID-19.

In conclusion, the paper identifies a potential drug target, the CREB/CBP interaction, using wet-lab techniques including transcriptomics, RNAi, and antiviral testing with a specific small molecule.

Title: Exploring the Druggability of Conserved RNA Regulatory Elements in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome
Keywords: Covid19-nmr; NMR spectroscopy; RNA; SARS-CoV-2; fragment screening.
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex-vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non-base-paired regions that potentially harbor ligand-binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR-based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1 H-based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA-element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.","This paper investigates the RNA elements of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as potential drug targets.

The researchers employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a wet-lab technique, to investigate these RNA elements and their potential to harbor ligand-binding pockets.

This approach can be considered a wet-lab approach because NMR spectroscopy is a physical experiment used to probe the structure of molecules, in this case, the RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2. The authors then performed a screening process with a library of 768 compounds to identify those that can bind to the RNA elements. This process of screening compounds for binding is also a form of wet-lab experiment, used to determine potential interactions between the RNA targets and possible drug molecules.

The paper does not identify an existing drug target, but rather, it identifies potential drug targets. The paper pinpoints specific RNA elements that could potentially be targeted by drug molecules, based on their ability to bind to the compounds from the library tested in this study. These elements are therefore potential drug targets, as they represent regions of the viral RNA that could potentially be manipulated to inhibit viral activity.

So, the paper uses a wet-lab approach to identify potential drug targets in the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Title: DNA-encoded chemistry technology yields expedient access to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors
Keywords: antiviral; covalent inhibitors; drug discovery.
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed more than 4 million humans globally, but there is no bona fide Food and Drug Administration-approved drug-like molecule to impede the COVID-19 pandemic. The sluggish pace of traditional therapeutic discovery is poorly suited to producing targeted treatments against rapidly evolving viruses. Here, we used an affinity-based screen of 4 billion DNA-encoded molecules en masse to identify a potent class of virus-specific inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) without extensive and time-consuming medicinal chemistry. CDD-1714, the initial three-building-block screening hit (molecular weight [MW] = 542.5 g/mol), was a potent inhibitor (inhibition constant [Ki] = 20 nM). CDD-1713, a smaller two-building-block analog (MW = 353.3 g/mol) of CDD-1714, is a reversible covalent inhibitor of Mpro (Ki = 45 nM) that binds in the protease pocket, has specificity over human proteases, and shows in vitro efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 infectivity model. Subsequently, key regions of CDD-1713 that were necessary for inhibitory activity were identified and a potent (Ki = 37 nM), smaller (MW = 323.4 g/mol), and metabolically more stable analog (CDD-1976) was generated. Thus, screening of DNA-encoded chemical libraries can accelerate the discovery of efficacious drug-like inhibitors of emerging viral disease targets.","Based on the information provided in the paper, we can evaluate whether the paper identifies an existing or potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.

The paper describes a DNA-encoded chemistry technology used to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is an enzyme essential for the replication of the virus. The researchers conducted an affinity-based screen of 4 billion DNA-encoded molecules to identify a class of virus-specific inhibitors of Mpro. They discovered CDD-1714, a screening hit that exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Mpro.

To further explore and optimize the inhibitory activity, the researchers designed a smaller analog called CDD-1713, which was a reversible covalent inhibitor of Mpro. They performed in vitro assays and evaluated the efficacy of CDD-1713 in a SARS-CoV-2 infectivity model. They also identified key regions of CDD-1713 necessary for its inhibitory activity and generated a smaller and more stable analog called CDD-1976, which exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Mpro.

Title: Effect of dihydromyricetin on SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis
Keywords: COVID-19; Dihydromyricetin; Pulmonary fibrosis; Pulmonary inflammation; SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).
Abstract: Background: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) has spread widely around the world and impacted human health for millions. The lack of effective targeted drugs and vaccines forces scientific world to search for new effective antiviral therapeutic drugs. It has reported that flavonoids have potential inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and anti-inflammatory properties. Dihydromyricetin, as a flavonol, also has antiviral and anti-inflammatory potential. However, the inhibition of dihydromyricetin on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the protective effect of dihydromyricetin on pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis have not been proved and explained. Purpose: The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and to be recognized as an attractive drug target, we expect to find the inhibitor of Mpro. Novel coronavirus infection can cause severe inflammation and even sequelae of pulmonary fibrosis in critically ill patients. We hope to find a drug that can not only inhibit virus replication but also alleviate inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis in patients. Methods: FRET-based enzymatic assay was used to evaluate the inhibit activity of dihydromyricetin on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Molecular docking was used to identify the binding pose of dihydromyricetin with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The protective effects of dihydromyricetin against BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were investigated in C57BL6 mice. BALF and lung tissue were collected for inflammation cells count, ELISA, masson and HE staining, western blotting and immunohistochemistry to analyze the effects of dihydromyricetin on pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. MTT, western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and wound healing were used to analyze the effects of dihydromyricetin on lung fibrosis mechanisms in Mlg cells. Results: In this study, we found that dihydromyricetin is a potent inhibitor targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.716 Â± 0.419 Î¼M, using molecular docking and the FRET-based enzymatic assay. The binding pose of dihydromyricetin with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was identified using molecular docking method. In the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the dihydrochromone ring of dihydromyricetin interact with the imidazole side chain of His163 through Ï-Ï stacking. The 1-oxygen of dihydromyricetin forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Glu166. The 3-, 7-, 3'- and 4'-hydroxyl of dihydromyricetin interact with Gln189, Leu141, Arg188 and Thr190 through hydrogen bonds. Moreover, our results showed that dihydromyricetin can significantly alleviate BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the infiltration of inflammation cells and the secretion of inflammation factors in the early process and also ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by improving pulmonary function and down-regulate the expression of Î±-SMA and fibronectin in vivo. Our results also showed that dihydromyricetin inhibits the migration and activation of myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix production via transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²1/Smad signaling pathways. Conclusion: Dihydromyricetin is an effective inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and it prevents BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Dihydromyricetin will be a potential medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 and its sequelae.","This paper focuses on studying the effect of dihydromyricetin, a flavonol, on SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires rapid development of specific therapeutics and vaccines. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3CL Mpro, is an established drug target for the design of inhibitors to stop the virus replication. Repurposing existing clinical drugs can offer a faster route to treatments. Here, we report on the binding mode and inhibition properties of several inhibitors using room temperature X-ray crystallography and in vitro enzyme kinetics. The enzyme active-site cavity reveals a high degree of malleability, allowing aldehyde leupeptin and hepatitis C clinical protease inhibitors (telaprevir, narlaprevir, and boceprevir) to bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro. Narlaprevir, boceprevir, and telaprevir are low-micromolar inhibitors, whereas the binding affinity of leupeptin is substantially weaker. Repurposing hepatitis C clinical drugs as COVID-19 treatments may be a useful option to pursue. The observed malleability of the enzyme active-site cavity should be considered for the successful design of specific protease inhibitors.","The paper focuses on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, called 3CL Mpro, which is a key enzyme in the virus's life cycle. This protease is an established drug target, as inhibiting its function effectively stops the virus from replicating.

In the study, the researchers used a wet-lab approach to investigate the binding mode and inhibition properties of several inhibitors. They used room temperature X-ray crystallography, a technique that allows them to visualize the molecular structure of the protease and its interactions with potential inhibitors, and in vitro enzyme kinetics, which studies the rates at which these inhibitors interact with and affect the enzyme's function.

In this context, the wet-lab approach was used to test the binding of different inhibitors, including the hepatitis C clinical drugs telaprevir, narlaprevir, and boceprevir, to the 3CL Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that these drugs could bind and inhibit this protease.

The paper thus identifies the 3CL Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. They also offer important insights into the design of inhibitors targeting this protease by highlighting the malleability of its active site. This information could be critical in the development of future antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.

Title: Corilagin and 1,3,6-Tri- O-galloy-Î²-D-glucose: potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 variants
Abstract: The COVID-19 disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, first detected in December 2019, is still emerging through virus mutations. Although almost under control in some countries due to effective vaccines that are mitigating the worldwide pandemic, the urgency to develop additional vaccines and therapeutic treatments is imperative. In this work, the natural polyphenols corilagin and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloy-Î²-d-glucose (TGG) are investigated to determine the structural basis of inhibitor interactions as potential candidates to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into target cells. First, the therapeutic potential of the ligands are assessed on the ACE2/wild-type RBD. We first use molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics, to take into account the conformational flexibility that plays a significant role in ligand binding and that cannot be captured using only docking, and then analyze more precisely the affinity of these ligands using MMPBSA binding free energy. We show that both ligands bind to the ACE2/wild-type RBD interface with good affinities which might prevent the ACE2/RBD association. Second, we confirm the potency of these ligands to block the ACE2/RBD association using a combination of surface plasmon resonance and biochemical inhibition assays. These experiments confirm that TGG and, to a lesser extent, corilagin, inhibit the binding of RBD to ACE2. Both experiments and simulations show that the ligands interact preferentially with RBD, while weak binding is observed with ACE2, hence, avoiding potential physiological side-effects induced by the inhibition of ACE2. In addition to the wild-type RBD, we also study numerically three RBD mutations (E484K, N501Y and E484K/N501Y) found in the main SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns. We find that corilagin could be as effective for RBD/E484K but less effective for the RBD/N501Y and RBD/E484K-N501Y mutants, while TGG strongly binds at relevant locations to all three mutants, demonstrating the significant interest of these molecules as potential inhibitors for variants of SARS-CoV-2.","In the given research paper, the authors study the potential of the natural polyphenols corilagin and 1,3,6-tri-O-galloy-?-d-glucose (TGG) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into target cells. The paper presents a combination of computational and experimental techniques to evaluate these molecules as potential therapeutics.

The molecular target they are examining is the interface of ACE2, a protein on the surface of many types of human cells, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The virus uses this interaction to gain entry into cells, so disrupting it is a strategy for preventing infection.

For the computational approach, the authors use molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the binding interactions of the two polyphenols with the ACE2/RBD interface. They find that both ligands bind well to the interface and may inhibit the ACE2/RBD association.

In terms of a wet-lab approach, the paper indeed employs biochemical assays and surface plasmon resonance. These techniques are used to physically measure the ability of the ligands to block the ACE2/RBD interaction, confirming the findings from the computational analyses.

In summary, while the paper focuses on the inhibitory effects of certain molecules on SARS-CoV-2, the target they're investigating (the ACE2/RBD interface) is not a new or novel one. Instead, it's a well-known target for COVID-19 therapeutics. The contribution of this paper is to suggest two specific molecules that could act on this existing target.

Final Answer: Yes, the paper does identify an existing drug target (the ACE2/RBD interface) using a wet-lab approach (biochemical assays and surface plasmon resonance).",1,1,"{""drug_targets"": [""ACE2/RBD interface""]}

Title: The structure-based design of peptidomimetic inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 3C like protease as Potent anti-viral drug candidate
Keywords: 3C Like protease; Peptidomimetic inhibitors; SARS-CoV-2.
Abstract: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected millions of people and took hundreds of thousands of lives. Unfortunately, there is deficiency of effective medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19. 3C like protease (3CLPro) of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to the viral replication and transcription, and is an attractive target to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Targeting on the 3CLPro, we screened our protease inhibitor library and obtained compound 10a as hit to weakly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro, and determined the co-crystal structure of 10a and the protease. Based on the deep understanding on the protein-ligand complexes between the hit and SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro, we designed a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors, with outstanding inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro and excellent anti-viral potency against SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand complexes of the other key inhibitors with SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro were explicitly described by the X-ray co-crystal study. All such results suggest these peptidomimetic inhibitors could be further applied as encouraging drug candidates.","The paper focuses on the SARS-CoV-2 3C like protease (3CLPro), which is considered a promising target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This protease is crucial for the viral replication and transcription process, and inhibiting it could significantly hinder the virus's ability to propagate within the host.

The researchers in this study used a wet-lab approach in several ways. First, they screened their protease inhibitor library and found compound 10a, which showed some ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro. The study then confirmed this interaction through the determination of the co-crystal structure of 10a and the protease, which is a technique that involves using biophysical techniques to establish the binding between the two molecules.

Next, with a deep understanding of the protein-ligand complexes between the hit (compound 10a) and the SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro, the researchers designed a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors. The paper mentions that these new molecules have outstanding inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro and excellent anti-viral potency against SARS-CoV-2. The structural relationships of these inhibitors with SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro were further examined by X-ray co-crystal study, another common wet-lab technique used to define molecular interactions at a high resolution.

From the information provided, it's evident that this paper identifies an existing drug target (the SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro) and uses wet-lab techniques to study its interaction with potential inhibitors, thereby suggesting potential drug candidates.

Title: Novel Engineered SARS-CoV-2 HR1 Trimer Exhibits Improved Potency and Broad-Spectrum Activity against SARS-CoV-2 and Its Variants
Keywords: HR1; SARS-CoV-2; foldon; fusion inhibitor; trimer.
Abstract: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has substantially increased the risk to global public health. Multiple vaccines and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been authorized for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the emergence and spread of the viral variants may limit the effectiveness of these vaccines and antibodies. Fusion inhibitors targeting the HR1 domain of the viral S protein have been shown to broadly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. In theory, peptide inhibitors targeting the HR2 domain of the S protein should also be able to inhibit viral infection. However, previously reported HR1-derived peptide inhibitors targeting the HR2 domain exhibit poor inhibitory activities. Here, we engineered a novel HR1 trimer (HR1MFd) by conjugating the trimerization motif foldon to the C terminus of the HR1-derived peptide. HR1MFd showed significantly improved inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Mechanistically, HR1MFd possesses markedly increased Î±-helicity, thermostability, higher HR2 domain binding affinity, and better inhibition of S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion compared to the HR1 peptide. Therefore, HR1MFd lays the foundation to develop HR1-based fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 HR1 region are generally poor inhibitors. Here, we constructed a trimeric peptide HR1MFd by fusing the trimerization motif foldon to the C terminus of the HR1 peptide. HR1MFd was highly effective in blocking transductions by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudoviruses. In comparison with HR1M, HR1MFd adopted a much higher helical conformation, better thermostability, increased affinity to the viral HR2 domain, and better inhibition of S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. Overall, HR1MFd provides the information to develop effective HR1-derived peptides as fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","In this paper, the authors describe the design and testing of a new peptide inhibitor, called HR1MFd, targeted against the HR1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, using a wet-lab approach.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial component of the virus that enables it to enter and infect human cells. Specifically, the spike protein contains two key regions, HR1 and HR2, that interact with each other to bring the viral and host cell membranes together, facilitating viral entry into the cell.

Previous attempts to create inhibitors targeting the HR2 region using peptides derived from the HR1 region have shown poor inhibitory activity. The authors have addressed this by engineering a novel HR1 trimer, HR1MFd, which improves the potency and broad-spectrum activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

This HR1MFd was developed by attaching the trimerization motif foldon to the C terminus of the HR1-derived peptide. This change resulted in a trimeric peptide that exhibits superior inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants compared to the original HR1 peptide. This was achieved through improved ?-helicity, thermostability, and higher binding affinity for the HR2 domain.

The techniques used in the development and testing of this novel peptide inhibitor qualify as a wet-lab approach. These would include the synthesis of the HR1MFd peptide, measuring its binding affinity to the HR2 domain, and testing its ability to block viral entry in cell culture experiments.
 The paper identifies a potential drug target, the HR1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Structural Basis for the Inhibition of Coronaviral Main Proteases by a Benzothiazole-Based Inhibitor
Keywords: YH-53; coronavirus; inhibitor; main protease; warhead.
Abstract: The ongoing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused hundreds of millions of cases and millions of victims worldwide with serious consequences to global health and economies. Although many vaccines protecting against SARS-CoV-2 are currently available, constantly emerging new variants necessitate the development of alternative strategies for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Inhibitors that target the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme that promotes viral maturation, represent a key class of antivirals. Here, we showed that a peptidomimetic compound with benzothiazolyl ketone as warhead, YH-53, is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV Mpros. Crystal structures of Mpros from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV bound to the inhibitor YH-53 revealed a unique ligand-binding site, which provides new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication. A detailed analysis of these crystal structures defined the key molecular determinants required for inhibition and illustrate the binding mode of Mpros from other coronaviruses. In consideration of the important role of Mpro in developing antivirals against coronaviruses, insights derived from this study should add to the design of pan-coronaviral Mpro inhibitors that are safer and more effective.","This paper does indeed identify an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach. The researchers studied the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with the related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Mpro is an essential enzyme that promotes viral maturation, and inhibitors that target Mpro represent a key class of antivirals. In the context of this study, Mpro is the drug target.

The wet-lab approach is reflected in the researchers' use of crystallography, a technique that involves the physical manipulation of substances in a laboratory setting to determine their structural properties. The researchers used crystallography to determine the crystal structures of Mpros from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV when these proteins were bound to the inhibitor YH-53. Through this approach, they identified a unique ligand-binding site and revealed new insights into the mechanism of viral replication inhibition.

Additionally, YH-53, the peptidomimetic compound with a benzothiazolyl ketone warhead, showed effectiveness in inhibiting Mpros from these coronaviruses. The paper highlights that this molecule and its interaction with the target protein (Mpro) could be a crucial part of future pan-coronaviral antiviral designs. The characterization of this inhibitor-enzyme interaction, its effectiveness, and its mechanism of action, provides evidence for a potential wet-lab drug development process.

Title: Identification of 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLPro) inhibitors as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents
Abstract: Emerging outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major threat to public health. The morbidity is increasing due to lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs. Herein, we have identified potential drugs that target the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), the main protease that is pivotal for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Computational molecular modeling was used to screen 3987 FDA approved drugs, and 47 drugs were selected to study their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 specific 3CLpro enzyme in vitro. Our results indicate that boceprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir, ivermectin, and micafungin exhibited inhibitory effect towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies showed that ivermectin may require homodimeric form of 3CLpro enzyme for its inhibitory activity. In summary, these molecules could be useful to develop highly specific therapeutically viable drugs to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication either alone or in combination with drugs specific for other SARS-CoV-2 viral targets.","The paper titled ""Identification of 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLPro) inhibitors as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents"" indeed identifies an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach.

The drug target in question is the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), a crucial enzyme involved in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers have used computational molecular modeling to screen nearly 4000 FDA approved drugs, then chose 47 of them for further in vitro study to examine their inhibitory effects on the 3CLpro enzyme. The act of physically testing the drugs for inhibitory effects on the 3CLpro enzyme in vitro is a practical or ""wet-lab"" approach, as it involves conducting physical experiments rather than just theoretical or computational analysis.

The paper reports that six drugs - boceprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir, ivermectin, and micafungin - demonstrated an inhibitory effect towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies provided additional insights, suggesting that ivermectin may require a homodimeric form of the 3CLpro enzyme for its inhibitory activity.

In summary, the researchers identified potential inhibitors for an existing drug target, the 3CLpro enzyme, using a combination of computational analysis and a wet-lab approach.

Title: Discovery of Drug-Like Ligands for the Mac1 Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3
Keywords: COVID-19; antiviral drug target; coronavirus; macrodomain; thermal shift.
Abstract: Small molecules that bind the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 Mac1 domain in place of ADP-ribose could be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for COVID-19 antiviral drug discovery because Mac1 has been linked to the ability of coronaviruses to evade cellular detection. A high-throughput assay based on differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was therefore optimized and used to identify possible Mac1 ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. Numerous promising compounds included nucleotides, steroids, Î²-lactams, and benzimidazoles. The main drawback to this approach was that a high percentage of compounds in some libraries were found to influence the observed Mac1 melting temperature. To prioritize DSF screening hits, the shapes of the observed melting curves and initial assay fluorescence were examined, and the results were compared with virtual screens performed using AutoDock Vina. The molecular basis for alternate ligand binding was also examined by determining a structure of one of the hits, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, with atomic resolution.","The paper describes the identification of small molecules that could potentially bind to the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3). This Mac1 domain is part of the virus's machinery for evading cellular detection, which makes it a potential drug target for COVID-19 treatments. The approach taken in this study can be described as a wet-lab approach because it involves a high-throughput assay based on differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The DSF method involves physical manipulation of the samples and generates empirical data about the thermal stabilities of the protein under different conditions. It's used in this case to identify molecules that bind to the Mac1 domain and therefore could potentially influence the behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, the paper also talks about examining the molecular basis for alternate ligand binding by determining a structure of one of the hits, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, with atomic resolution, which is another example of a wet-lab technique.

Based on this information, the paper uses a wet-lab approach to identify potential ligands that could bind to an existing drug target, the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3.

Title: The NSP14/NSP10 RNA repair complex as a Pan-coronavirus therapeutic target
Abstract: The risk of zoonotic coronavirus spillover into the human population, as highlighted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demands the development of pan-coronavirus antivirals. The efficacy of existing antiviral ribonucleoside/ribonucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir, is decreased by the viral proofreading exonuclease NSP14-NSP10 complex. Here, using a novel assay and in silico modeling and screening, we identified NSP14-NSP10 inhibitors that increase remdesivir's potency. A model compound, sofalcone, both inhibits the exonuclease activity of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in vitro, and synergistically enhances the antiviral effect of remdesivir, suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the related human coronavirus OC43. The validation of top hits from our primary screenings using cellular systems provides proof-of-concept for the NSP14 complex as a therapeutic target.","The paper discusses the NSP14/NSP10 complex of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses as a possible target for antiviral therapies. This complex is an enzyme involved in the virus's proofreading mechanism, which enhances the virus's resistance against antiviral ribonucleoside/ribonucleotide analogs, such as remdesivir.

The researchers have developed an assay and used in silico (computational) modeling and screening methods to identify inhibitors of the NSP14-NSP10 complex, such as sofalcone, which can potentially enhance the potency of remdesivir. They have demonstrated that sofalcone inhibits the exonuclease activity of the NSP14-NSP10 complex in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in vitro, meaning these experiments were done in a controlled environment outside a living organism. Furthermore, sofalcone is shown to synergistically enhance the antiviral effect of remdesivir, suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and the related human coronavirus OC43.

The authors further validated their findings using cellular systems, thereby providing a proof-of-concept for the NSP14 complex as a therapeutic target. This implies a wet-lab approach, as these in vitro and cellular system validations involve physically conducting experiments in the lab.

Title: Going Retro, Going Viral: Experiences and Lessons in Drug Discovery from COVID-19
Keywords: NiRAN; SARS-CoV-2 RdRp; fidaxomicin; nucleotide analogs; rifamycins.
Abstract: The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of its global spread have motivated researchers to opt for repurposing existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 rather than discover or develop novel ones. For reasons of speed, throughput, and cost-effectiveness, virtual screening campaigns, relying heavily on in silico docking, have dominated published reports. A particular focus as a drug target has been the principal active site (i.e., RNA synthesis) of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), despite the existence of a second, and also indispensable, active site in the same enzyme. Here we report the results of our experimental interrogation of several small-molecule inhibitors, including natural products proposed to be effective by in silico studies. Notably, we find that two antibiotics in clinical use, fidaxomicin and rifabutin, inhibit RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in vitro and inhibit viral replication in cell culture. However, our mutagenesis studies contradict the binding sites predicted computationally. We discuss the implications of these and other findings for computational studies predicting the binding of ligands to large and flexible protein complexes and therefore for drug discovery or repurposing efforts utilizing such studies. Finally, we suggest several improvements on such efforts ongoing against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens as they arise.","The paper does identify an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach. It discusses the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 as a drug target. RdRp is an essential enzyme for the replication of the virus, and therefore, inhibiting this enzyme could potentially prevent the virus from multiplying within the host. This paper explores RdRp's principal active site (RNA synthesis) as the target.

Importantly, the paper not only theorizes about RdRp as a target but also conducts wet-lab research to validate this. The researchers use in vitro assays to study the effect of several small-molecule inhibitors on RdRp activity and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Specifically, they find that two antibiotics, fidaxomicin and rifabutin, inhibit RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in vitro and also inhibit viral replication in cell culture. They also perform mutagenesis studies to determine the binding sites of these inhibitors on RdRp, providing experimental evidence that contradicts the predictions made by computational docking studies.

So, the paper does indeed utilize a wet-lab approach to identify an existing drug target, which in this case is the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.

Title: Structural Characteristics of Heparin Binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD of Omicron Sub-Lineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5
Keywords: Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; heparin; mucopolysaccharide polysulfate; pentosan polysulfate; spike protein RBD.
Abstract: The now prevalent Omicron variant and its subvariants/sub-lineages have led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases and raised serious concerns about increased risk of infectivity, immune evasion, and reinfection. Heparan sulfate (HS), located on the surface of host cells, plays an important role as a co-receptor for virus-host cell interaction. The ability of heparin and HS to compete for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to cell surface HS illustrates the therapeutic potential of agents targeting protein-glycan interactions. In the current study, phylogenetic tree of variants and mutations in S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 were described. The binding affinity of Omicron S protein RBD to heparin was further investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Solution competition studies on the inhibitory activity of heparin oligosaccharides and desulfated heparins at different sites on S protein RBD-heparin interactions revealed that different sub-lineages tend to bind heparin with different chain lengths and sulfation patterns. Furthermore, blind docking experiments showed the contribution of basic amino acid residues in RBD and sulfo groups and carboxyl groups on heparin to the interaction. Finally, pentosan polysulfate and mucopolysaccharide polysulfate were evaluated for inhibition on the interaction of heparin and S protein RBD of Omicron BA.2.12.1, BA.4/BA.5, and both showed much stronger inhibition than heparin.","The paper presented discusses the structural characteristics of heparin binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Omicron sub-lineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its RBD, is known to play an important role in enabling the virus to bind to host cells and initiate infection. In this study, the researchers examined the binding affinity of the Omicron variant's spike protein RBD to heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant medication, using wet-lab techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), competition studies, and docking experiments.

Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cellular surface molecule that acts as a co-receptor for the virus-host cell interaction. Heparin, a structurally related molecule to HS, can compete with HS for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, potentially preventing the virus from successfully binding to host cells. This suggests that the spike protein RBD - HS interaction could potentially serve as a therapeutic target. In other words, the researchers are investigating the interaction between heparin and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a possible drug target.

Moreover, the study also investigated the inhibitory activity of different forms of heparin and other related compounds (pentosan polysulfate and mucopolysaccharide polysulfate) on the interaction between heparin and the S protein RBD. The researchers found that these compounds showed stronger inhibitory effects than heparin itself, suggesting that they could potentially serve as more effective therapeutic agents.

So, this paper does identify the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with heparin/HS as a potential drug target, and it does so using a wet-lab approach, specifically through the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), competition studies, and docking experiments to investigate this interaction and potential inhibitors of it.

Title: Tipiracil binds to uridine site and inhibits Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2
Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is a uridine-specific endoribonuclease with C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family that is highly conserved in coronaviruses. As endoribonuclease activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response, Nsp15 emerges as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the first structures with bound nucleotides and show how the enzyme specifically recognizes uridine moiety. In addition to a uridine site we present evidence for a second base binding site that can accommodate any base. The structure with a transition state analog, uridine vanadate, confirms interactions key to catalytic mechanisms. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. This acquired knowledge was instrumental in identifying Tipiracil, an FDA approved drug that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, as a potential anti-COVID-19 drug. Using crystallography, biochemical, and whole-cell assays, we demonstrate that Tipiracil inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by interacting with the uridine binding pocket in the enzyme's active site. Our findings provide new insights for the development of uracil scaffold-based drugs.","This paper does identify an existing or potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, a uridine-specific endoribonuclease, is pinpointed as a crucial element in the virus's ability to interfere with the innate immune response. Due to this key role, it is identified as a potential drug target for therapeutic intervention.

A wet-lab approach is used to elucidate the structure and function of this endoribonuclease. The study used methods like crystallography and biochemical assays, which are indicative of physical, non-computational experimental procedures typically used in wet-lab research. The investigators identified and described two binding sites of this enzyme - a uridine site and a second site that can accommodate any base.

Subsequently, the study investigated the effects of Tipiracil, an FDA-approved colorectal cancer drug, on Nsp15. The drug was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by interacting with the uridine binding pocket in the enzyme's active site. This finding was demonstrated through further crystallography, biochemical, and whole-cell assays, which once again points towards a wet-lab approach.

In summary, this study identified Nsp15 as a potential drug target and demonstrated that Tipiracil can inhibit this target through wet-lab experiments.

Title: Identification of Aloe-derived natural products as prospective lead scaffolds for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors
Keywords: 3CL(pro); Aloe; Aloesin; M(pro); Natural products; Protease inhibitors; SARS-CoV-2 main protease; aloeresin D.
Abstract: In the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 5 million deaths and 250 million infections worldwide. Despite successful vaccination efforts and emergency approval of small molecule therapies, a diverse range of antivirals is still needed to combat the inevitable resistance that will arise from new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) is an attractive drug target due to the clinical success of protease inhibitors against other viruses, such as HIV and HCV. However, in order to combat resistance, various chemical scaffolds need to be identified that have the potential to be developed into potent inhibitors. To this end, we screened a high-content protease inhibitor library against Mproin vitro, in order to identify structurally diverse compounds that could be further developed into antiviral leads. Our high-content screening efforts retrieved 27 hits each with > 50% inhibition in our Mpro FRET assay. Of these, four of the top inhibitor compounds were chosen for follow-up due to their potency and drugability (Lipinski's rules of five criteria): anacardic acid, aloesin, aloeresin D, and TCID. Further analysis via dose response curves revealed IC50 values of 6.8 Î¼M, 38.9 Î¼M, 125.3 Î¼M, and 138.0 Î¼M for each compound, respectively. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that the four inhibitors bound at the catalytic active site of Mpro with varying binding energies (-7.5 to -5.6 kcal/mol). Furthermore, Mpro FRET assay kinetic studies demonstrated that Mpro catalysis is better represented by a sigmoidal Hill model than the standard Michaelis-Menten hyperbola, indicating substantial cooperativity of the active enzyme dimer. This result suggests that the dimerization interface could be an attractive target for allosteric inhibitors. In conclusion, we identified two closely-related natural product compounds from the Aloe plant (aloesin and aloeresin D) that may serve as novel scaffolds for Mpro inhibitor design and additionally confirmed the strongly cooperative kinetics of Mpro proteolysis. These results further advance our knowledge of structure-function relationships in Mpro and offer new molecular scaffolds for inhibitor design.","The paper discusses research that targets the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) using a wet-lab approach. Mpro is a macromolecule in SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the replication of the virus in the host body, making it an attractive drug target. The main aim of this research is to identify structurally diverse compounds that could be developed into potent inhibitors against Mpro.

The researchers perform a high-content screen, an experimental method conducted in a wet-lab setting, against Mpro using a protease inhibitor library to identify potential inhibitors. The high-content screen involves conducting in vitro assays, which fall under the definition of a wet-lab approach. The screen identifies 27 hits, of which the top four compounds were selected for further analysis due to their potency and druggability, according to Lipinski's rules of five criteria. These include two compounds from the Aloe plant, aloesin and aloeresin D.

Further wet-lab experiments, such as dose-response curves, molecular docking studies, and Mpro FRET assay kinetic studies, are conducted to determine the potency of these compounds (IC50 values), to predict how these compounds interact with Mpro (binding energies), and to understand the kinetics of Mpro catalysis.

Therefore, based on this evidence, the paper does identify an existing drug target (Mpro) and proposes potential inhibitors against this target using a wet-lab approach.
