Title: Exploring the Human-Nipah Virus Protein-Protein Interactome
Keywords: MS; Nipah; mass spectrometry; paramyxovirus; protein-protein interaction; virology; virus-host interactions.
Abstract: Nipah virus is an emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. Human transmission occurs by close contact with infected animals, the consumption of contaminated food, or, occasionally, via other infected individuals. Currently, we lack therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for Nipah virus. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. This aim led us to perform the present work, in which we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), most of which (88) are novel. This data set provides a comprehensive view of the host complexes that are manipulated by viral proteins. Host targets include the PRP19 complex and the microRNA (miRNA) processing machinery. Furthermore, we explored the biologic consequences of the interaction with the PRP19 complex and found that the Nipah virus W protein is capable of altering p53 control and gene expression. We anticipate that these data will help in guiding the development of novel interventional strategies to counter this emerging viral threat.IMPORTANCE Nipah virus is a recently discovered virus that infects a wide range of mammals, including humans. Since its discovery there have been yearly outbreaks, and in some of them the mortality rate has reached 100% of the confirmed cases. However, the study of Nipah virus has been largely neglected, and currently we lack treatments for this infection. To develop these agents we must now improve our understanding of the host-virus interactions that underpin a productive infection. In the present work, we identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions using an affinity purification approach coupled with mass spectrometry. Additionally, we explored the cellular consequences of some of these interactions. Globally, this data set offers a comprehensive and detailed view of the host machinery's contribution to the Nipah virus's life cycle. Furthermore, our data present a large number of putative drug targets that could be exploited for the treatment of this infection.","The paper titled ""Exploring the Human-Nipah Virus Protein-Protein Interactome"" primarily aims to understand the protein-protein interactions between the Nipah virus and human host cells. It identified 101 human-Nipah virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs), providing a comprehensive view of the host complexes that are manipulated by viral proteins. Among the host targets mentioned are the PRP19 complex and the microRNA (miRNA) processing machinery.

The authors also studied the biological consequences of these interactions. For instance, they found that the Nipah virus W protein could interfere with the PRP19 complex, resulting in alterations to p53 control and gene expression. p53 is a protein that prevents cancer and is known as a ""tumor suppressor"". Disruptions in its functioning can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of cancer. Therefore, the interaction of the Nipah virus W protein with the PRP19 complex could potentially lead to detrimental health effects.

The authors suggest that this understanding of host-virus interactions could guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counter the Nipah virus infection. Thus, these identified PPIs, including the interaction of the Nipah virus W protein with the PRP19 complex, represent potential drug targets. Drugs could be developed to disrupt these interactions, thus preventing the virus from hijacking host cellular machinery for its replication and spread.

The methodology used to identify these PPIs involved an affinity purification approach coupled with mass spectrometry. These are wet-lab techniques, as they involve physically conducting non-computational experiments to study the interactions between molecules.

Therefore, the paper does identify potential drug targets using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Heparan sulfate-dependent enhancement of henipavirus infection
Abstract: Nipah virus and Hendra virus are emerging, highly pathogenic, zoonotic paramyxoviruses that belong to the genus Henipavirus. They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections. Importance: The Henipavirus genus includes two closely related, highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus and Hendra virus, which cause elevated morbidity and mortality in animals and humans. Pathogenesis of both Nipah virus and Hendra virus infection is poorly understood, and efficient antiviral treatment is still missing. Here, we identified heparan sulfate as a novel attachment receptor used by both viruses to bind host cells. We demonstrate that heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin also bound to the viral entry receptor and thereby restricted infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, heparin treatment improved survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. These results uncover an important role of heparan sulfate in henipavirus infection and open novel perspectives for the development of heparan sulfate-targeting therapeutic approaches for these emerging infections.","This paper identifies a new attachment receptor for the Nipah and Hendra viruses, heparan sulfate, using wet-lab techniques. The attachment receptor is essential for the virus's ability to bind to host cells and facilitate its infection process. Heparan sulfate is a type of molecule present on cell surfaces, and it was discovered to enhance the ability of the viruses to infect host cells.

The authors of the study conducted several in vitro (wet-lab) experiments to validate their hypothesis. One of these experiments was a surface plasmon resonance assay, a biophysical technique, to show that virus particles pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins specifically bind to heparan sulfate and heparin. Another experiment showed that heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the virus with heparan sulfate and also blocked cell-mediated trans-infection of the viruses.

Moreover, the authors conducted an in vivo study, another wet-lab technique, demonstrating that treatment with a specific form of heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. This suggests that targeting heparan sulfate or using heparin could potentially serve as a therapeutic approach to treating infections caused by these viruses.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that this paper identifies a potential drug target, heparan sulfate, for Nipah and Hendra viruses using a wet-lab approach. The paper also identifies heparin as a potential drug due to its ability to bind to heparan sulfate and the viral entry receptor, thereby inhibiting the viruses' binding and subsequent infection process.

Title: Inhibition of Nipah virus infection in vivo: targeting an early stage of paramyxovirus fusion activation during viral entry
Abstract: In the paramyxovirus cell entry process, receptor binding triggers conformational changes in the fusion protein (F) leading to viral and cellular membrane fusion. Peptides derived from C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) regions in F have been shown to inhibit fusion by preventing formation of the fusogenic six-helix bundle. We recently showed that the addition of a cholesterol group to HRC peptides active against Nipah virus targets these peptides to the membrane where fusion occurs, dramatically increasing their antiviral effect. In this work, we report that unlike the untagged HRC peptides, which bind to the postulated extended intermediate state bridging the viral and cell membranes, the cholesterol tagged HRC-derived peptides interact with F before the fusion peptide inserts into the target cell membrane, thus capturing an earlier stage in the F-activation process. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol tagging renders these peptides active in vivo: the cholesterol-tagged peptides cross the blood brain barrier, and effectively prevent and treat in an established animal model what would otherwise be fatal Nipah virus encephalitis. The in vivo efficacy of cholesterol-tagged peptides, and in particular their ability to penetrate the CNS, suggests that they are promising candidates for the prevention or therapy of infection by Nipah and other lethal paramyxoviruses.","The paper focuses on a method to inhibit the Nipah virus (NiV) infection using peptides derived from C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) regions in the fusion protein (F) of the virus, specifically the cholesterol-tagged version of these peptides. These peptides have been shown to bind to and inhibit the F protein, thus inhibiting the virus's ability to fuse with and enter host cells. The F protein here can be viewed as a drug target, as it is a macromolecule intrinsic to the virus (thus, the disease process) that the peptides (the ""drug"" in this case) are directed at and bind to, resulting in a desired therapeutic effectÂnamely, the prevention of viral entry into host cells.

The paper also presents a wet-lab approach in its experiments. It mentions that the cholesterol-tagged peptides are active in vivo, implying that the experiments were carried out in a live organism. In addition, the mention of an ""established animal model"" suggests that the peptides were tested on animals to evaluate their effect on Nipah virus encephalitis, a physical experiment outside of computational methods.

Therefore, it appears that the paper identifies the F protein of the Nipah virus as a drug target and employs a wet-lab approach to test the therapeutic effects of cholesterol-tagged HRC-derived peptides on this target.

Title: Genome-wide analysis reveals a regulatory role for G-quadruplexes during Adenovirus multiplication
Keywords: Adenovirus-based vectors; Braco-19; G-quadruplex; Human Adenovirus; Virus multiplication.
Abstract: The G-quadruplex (GQ) motifs have recently been gaining prominence because of their role as gene cis-regulatory elements in a variety of organisms and as potential druggable targets for anti-cancer therapy and ageing. Several studies have demonstrated the existence of GQs in the genomes of emerging and re-emerging human pathogens, such as hepatitis virus, herpesviruses, Ebola virus, Zika virus and Nipah virus. Human Adenovirus (HAdV) exhibits a large number of clinical manifestations especially infecting the children and the immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the HAdV-based vectors have been widely used to deliver foreign DNAs to cells in gene therapy. However, the DNA secondary structural elements in AdV-based vectors could significantly determine the gene delivery efficacy of the vectors. In this study, using a combination of whole genome sequence analysis, biochemical, biophysical and interaction assays, we revealed fifteen putative GQs that are conserved across the different species of HAdV. We further showed that the GQs are embedded in the sequences of essential viral genes, namely E1B, E2B, and L3 genes (among others), which are involved in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle. Notably, Braco-19 (a well-known GQ binding ligand) interacted specifically with the HAdV GQs and increased their stability and further blocked the HAdV multiplication in human cells. Taken together, our data strongly supported the existence of G-quadruplex structures in the HAdV genome that affect the virus multiplication and posit that such structures may influence the efficacy of the gene-delivery vectors or even the HAdV virus life-cycle.","This paper investigates the role of G-quadruplexes (GQs) in the genome of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) and their potential impact on the virus' multiplication. GQs are molecular structures formed in nucleic acids and are found in the genomes of various organisms and viruses. They have been recognized as potential druggable targets for several conditions including cancer and aging.

In the study, the researchers use a combination of whole genome sequence analysis, biochemical, biophysical, and interaction assays, which fall under the definition of a wet-lab approach, as they involve physically conducting non-computational experiments. They identify fifteen putative GQs that are conserved across different species of HAdV. These GQs are located within essential viral genes that are involved in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, including E1B, E2B, and L3 genes.

Moreover, the researchers show that Braco-19, a known GQ binding ligand, can specifically interact with these HAdV GQs, stabilizing them and consequently blocking HAdV multiplication in human cells. This implies that the GQs in the HAdV genome, when targeted and stabilized by molecules like Braco-19, can inhibit the viral life cycle. Therefore, these GQs could be considered as potential drug targets.

The paper does not explore whether these targets have been previously identified or targeted by other drugs, but within the context of this study, these GQs represent potential new drug targets for HAdV, identified through a wet-lab approach.

Title: Conserved G-Quadruplex Motifs in Gene Promoter Region Reveals a Novel Therapeutic Approach to Target Multi-Drug Resistance Klebsiella pneumoniae
Keywords: Klebsiella pneumoniae; g-quadruplex; multi-drug resistance; non-canonical structures; therapeutic target.
Abstract: An opportunistic pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae is known to cause life-threating nosocomial infection with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Evolutions of multi-drug-resistant and hyper-virulent strains of K. pneumoniae make the situation worse. Currently, there is no incisive drug molecule available for drug-resistant hyper-virulent K. pneumoniae infection that emphasizes the need for identification of novel and more promising drug targets in K. pneumoniae. Recently, various non-canonical structures of nucleic acids especially G-quadruplex (G4) motifs have been identified as potential therapeutic targets against several human pathogenic bacteria and viruses including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and Nipah. Therefore, in present study we screened the K. pneumoniae genomes for identification of evolutionary conserved G4 structure-forming motifs as promising anti-bacterial drug targets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of six highly conserved G4 motifs in the promoter region of five essential genes that play a critical role in nutrient transport and metabolism. Biophysical studies showed the formation of G4 structure by these conserved motifs. Circular Dichroism melting analysis showed the stabilization of these G4 motifs by a well-known G4-stabilizing agent, BRACO-19. The stabilization of these motifs by BRACO-19 was also able to stop the primer extension process, which is an essential phenomenon for expression of the G4-harboring gene. The addition of G4-specific ligand at low micromolar range was observed to be lethal for the growth of this bacteria and negatively controlled the expression of the G4-harboring genes via G4 structure stabilization. These observations strengthen the formation of G4 structures by the predicted G4 motif in vivo, which can be stabilized by G4 ligands like BRACO-19. This stabilization of G4 structures can attenuate the expression of G4-harboring essential genes and thus play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. Thus, taking all given result in consideration, for the first time, this study showed the new therapeutic avenue for combating K. pneumoniae infection by characterizing the conserved G4 motifs as promising therapeutic targets.","The paper explores the idea of G-quadruplex (G4) motifs as potential drug targets for treating multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. G4 motifs are specific, non-canonical structures of nucleic acids that have been identified as potential therapeutic targets against several pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The study has identified conserved G4 motifs within the promoter region of five essential genes in K. pneumoniae.

The authors used a wet-lab approach, employing biophysical studies and the Circular Dichroism melting analysis, to confirm the formation and stabilization of G4 structures by these conserved motifs. They also experimented with the G4-stabilizing agent, BRACO-19, demonstrating that stabilization of these motifs can stop the primer extension process, which is essential for gene expression.

Further, the researchers observed that the addition of a G4-specific ligand at low micromolar range was lethal for the growth of K. pneumoniae and inhibited the expression of the G4-harboring genes via G4 structure stabilization. These findings support the formation of G4 structures by the predicted G4 motif in vivo and suggest that their stabilization can attenuate the expression of G4-harboring essential genes, thus playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.

In summary, the paper does identify an existing potential drug target - the G4 motifs in the promoter regions of essential genes in K. pneumoniae - and uses a wet-lab approach to do so, demonstrating the interaction between these G4 structures and the G4-stabilizing agent BRACO-19, and the impact of this interaction on the growth and gene expression of K. pneumoniae.

Title: Discovery of Cofactor Competitive Inhibitors against the Human Methyltransferase Fibrillarin
Keywords: S-adenosyl methionine; cofactor; fragment screening; inhibitors; methyltransferase.
Abstract: Fibrillarin (FBL) is an essential and evolutionarily highly conserved S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase. It is the catalytic component of a multiprotein complex that facilitates 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), a modification essential for accurate and efficient protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It was recently established that human FBL (hFBL) is critical for Nipah, Hendra, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. In addition, overexpression of hFBL contributes towards tumorgenesis and is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer, suggesting that hFBL is a potential target for the development of both antiviral and anticancer drugs. An attractive strategy to target cofactor-dependent enzymes is the selective inhibition of cofactor binding, which has been successful for the development of inhibitors against several protein methyltransferases including PRMT5, DOT1L, and EZH2. In this work, we solved crystal structures of the methyltransferase domain of hFBL in apo form and in complex with the cofactor SAM. Screening of a fluorinated fragment library, via X-ray crystallography and 19F NMR spectroscopy, yielded seven hit compounds that competed with cofactor binding, two of which resulted in co-crystal structures. One of these structures revealed unexpected conformational variability in the cofactor binding site, which allows it to accommodate a compound significantly different from SAM. Our structural data provide critical information for the design of selective cofactor competitive inhibitors targeting hFBL, and preliminary elaboration of hit compounds has led to additional cofactor site binders.","The paper focuses on the human methyltransferase Fibrillarin (hFBL). hFBL is a protein that plays a critical role in various biological processes, such as the 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), which is essential for accurate and efficient protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Importantly, the paper mentions that hFBL is critical for Nipah, Hendra, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Overexpression of hFBL also contributes towards tumorigenesis and is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. Hence, hFBL is suggested to be a potential target for the development of both antiviral and anticancer drugs.

The researchers in this paper utilize a wet-lab approach, including X-ray crystallography and 19F NMR spectroscopy, to understand the structure of hFBL and how it binds with its cofactor, SAM. They then screen a library of fluorinated fragment molecules to identify ones that can compete with SAM for binding to hFBL, essentially looking for potential inhibitors of the protein. They discover seven ""hit"" compounds that compete with cofactor binding and further elaborate to identify additional cofactor site binders.

It's important to note that a drug target is a macromolecule in the body that is intrinsically associated with a disease process, and to which a drug is directed and/or binds, resulting in a desired therapeutic effect. In this case, the researchers are trying to inhibit the function of hFBL because of its involvement in viral infections and cancer, and they are identifying molecules that could potentially bind to it and disrupt its normal function. Therefore, hFBL could be considered a potential drug target.

Title: Matrix proteins of Nipah and Hendra viruses interact with beta subunits of AP-3 complexes
Abstract: Paramyxoviruses and other negative-strand RNA viruses encode matrix proteins that coordinate the virus assembly process. The matrix proteins link the viral glycoproteins and the viral ribonucleoproteins at virus assembly sites and often recruit host machinery that facilitates the budding process. Using a co-affinity purification strategy, we have identified the beta subunit of the AP-3 adapter protein complex, AP3B1, as a binding partner for the M proteins of the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Binding function was localized to the serine-rich and acidic Hinge domain of AP3B1, and a 29-amino-acid Hinge-derived polypeptide was sufficient for M protein binding in coimmunoprecipitation assays. Virus-like particle (VLP) production assays were used to assess the relationship between AP3B1 binding and M protein function. We found that for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus, M protein expression in the absence of any other viral proteins led to the efficient production of VLPs in transfected cells, and this VLP production was potently inhibited upon overexpression of short M-binding polypeptides derived from the Hinge region of AP3B1. Both human and bat (Pteropus alecto) AP3B1-derived polypeptides were highly effective at inhibiting the production of VLPs. VLP production was also impaired through small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of AP3B1 from cells. These findings suggest that AP-3-directed trafficking processes are important for henipavirus particle production and identify a new host protein-virus protein binding interface that could become a useful target in future efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors to combat paramyxoviral infections. Importance: Henipaviruses cause deadly infections in humans, with a mortality rate of about 40%. Hendra virus outbreaks in Australia, all involving horses and some involving transmission to humans, have been a continuing problem. Nipah virus caused a large outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, killing 109 people, and smaller outbreaks have since occurred in Bangladesh and India. In this study, we have defined, for the first time, host factors that interact with henipavirus M proteins and contribute to viral particle assembly. We have also defined a new host protein-viral protein binding interface that can potentially be targeted for the inhibition of paramyxovirus infections.","This paper does indeed identify a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.
Firstly, the authors used a co-affinity purification strategy, which is a wet-lab technique, to identify a binding partner for the matrix proteins of the Nipah and Hendra viruses. This binding partner is the beta subunit of the AP-3 adapter protein complex, AP3B1.
After identifying AP3B1 as a binding partner, the authors pinpointed the serine-rich and acidic Hinge domain of AP3B1 as the specific binding site for the viral matrix proteins. They found that a 29-amino-acid polypeptide derived from the Hinge domain was sufficient for binding the M protein of the viruses in coimmunoprecipitation assays, another wet-lab experiment.
Moreover, the authors used virus-like particle (VLP) production assays, a type of in vitro assay, to further examine the relationship between AP3B1 binding and M protein function. They found that M protein expression alone could lead to the efficient production of VLPs, which was significantly inhibited by the overexpression of short M-binding polypeptides derived from the Hinge region of AP3B1.
Furthermore, the authors used siRNA to deplete AP3B1 from cells and found that this impaired VLP production, suggesting that AP-3-directed trafficking processes are essential for henipavirus particle production.
Taken together, these findings suggest that the interaction between the matrix proteins of henipaviruses and the Hinge domain of AP3B1 could serve as a potential drug target. Inhibition of this interaction could disrupt virus assembly and thereby prevent the progression of infection. Thus, the authors have used wet-lab approaches to identify a new host protein-virus protein binding interface that could be targeted for the development of small molecule inhibitors to combat paramyxoviral infections.

Title: Structure of Nipah virus unassembled nucleoprotein in complex with its viral chaperone
Abstract: Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emergent paramyxovirus causing deadly encephalitis in humans. Its replication requires a constant supply of unassembled nucleoprotein (N(0)) in complex with its viral chaperone, the phosphoprotein (P). To elucidate the chaperone function of P, we reconstituted NiV the N(0)-P core complex and determined its crystal structure. The binding of the N-terminal region of P blocks the polymerization of N by interfering with subdomain exchange between N protomers and keeps N(0) in an open conformation, ready to grasp an RNA molecule. We found that a peptide derived from the N-binding region of P protects cells against viral infection and demonstrated by structure-based mutagenesis that this peptide acts by inhibiting N(0)-P formation. These results provide new insights about the assembly of N along genomic RNA and validate the N(0)-P complex as a target for drug development.","The paper presents structural and functional studies on the nucleoprotein (N(0)) of the Nipah virus (NiV) and its interaction with its viral chaperone, the phosphoprotein (P). The nucleoprotein and the phosphoprotein together form a complex, the N(0)-P complex, which is crucial for the replication of the virus. The authors carried out experimental work to understand how the phosphoprotein acts as a chaperone for the nucleoprotein, using methods likely falling within the scope of a 'wet-lab' approach (as they involve physical, non-computational experiments).
The authors describe the discovery of a peptide (a small protein fragment) derived from the phosphoprotein that can protect cells from viral infection. This protective effect is attributed to the peptide's ability to inhibit the formation of the N(0)-P complex, which, as mentioned, is essential for the virus's replication.
The fact that this peptide can block viral replication by preventing the formation of a key viral complex suggests that the N(0)-P complex could be a potential target for drug development. The peptide itself, or other molecules that can disrupt this complex, could be potentially useful as therapeutics against NiV infection.
In conclusion, the paper does identify a potential drug target, namely the N(0)-P complex, using a wet-lab approach, as evidenced by the experimental work undertaken to characterize the function and structure of this complex and the effect of the peptide derived from the phosphoprotein.

Title: Broadly neutralizing antibody cocktails targeting Nipah virus and Hendra virus fusion glycoproteins
Abstract: Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are henipaviruses (HNVs) causing respiratory illness and severe encephalitis in humans, with fatality rates of 50-100%. There are no licensed therapeutics or vaccines to protect humans. HeV and NiV use a receptor-binding glycoprotein (G) and a fusion glycoprotein (F) to enter host cells. HNV F and G are the main targets of the humoral immune response, and the presence of neutralizing antibodies is a correlate of protection against NiV and HeV in experimentally infected animals. We describe here two cross-reactive F-specific antibodies, 1F5 and 12B2, that neutralize NiV and HeV through inhibition of membrane fusion. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that 1F5 and 12B2 recognize distinct prefusion-specific, conserved quaternary epitopes and lock F in its prefusion conformation. We provide proof-of-concept for using antibody cocktails for neutralizing NiV and HeV and define a roadmap for developing effective countermeasures against these highly pathogenic viruses.","This paper focuses on two cross-reactive F-specific antibodies, 1F5 and 12B2, that neutralize Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) through inhibition of membrane fusion.

Title: Identification and characterization of two conserved G-quadruplex forming motifs in the Nipah virus genome and their interaction with G-quadruplex specific ligands
Abstract: The G-quadruplex (GQ) motifs are considered as potential drug-target sites for several human pathogenic viruses such as Zika, Hepatitis, Ebola, and Human Herpesviruses. The recent outbreaks of Nipah virus (NiV) in India, the highly fatal emerging zoonotic virus is a potential threat to global health security as no anti-viral drug or vaccine in currently available. Therefore, here in the present study, we sought to assess the ability of the putative G-quadruplex forming sequences in the NiV genome to form G-quadruplex structures and act as targets for anti-viral compounds. Bioinformatics analysis underpinned by various biophysical and biochemical techniques (such as NMR, CD, EMSA, DMS footprinting assay) confirmed the presence of two highly conserved G-quadruplex forming sequences (HGQs) in the G and L genes of NiV. These genes encode the cell attachment glycoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively and are essential for the virus entry and replication within the host cell. It remains possible that stabilization of these HGQs by the known G-quadruplex binding ligands like TMPyP4 and Braco-19 represents a promising strategy to inhibit the expression of the HGQ harboring genes and thereby stop the viral entry and replication inside the host cell. Accordingly, we report for the first time, that HGQs in Nipah virus genome are targets for G-quadruplex specific ligands; therefore, could serve as potential targets for anti-viral therapy.","The paper presents an investigation into the G-quadruplex (GQ) motifs in the Nipah virus (NiV) genome as potential drug targets.

Using bioinformatics analysis and various biophysical and biochemical techniques such as NMR, CD, EMSA, and DMS footprinting assay, the researchers confirmed the presence of these G-quadruplex structures, which they referred to as HGQs. Furthermore, the researchers explored the possible inhibition of viral replication and entry by stabilizing these HGQs using known G-quadruplex binding ligands like TMPyP4 and Braco-19. These ligands have the potential to prevent the expression of the HGQ harboring genes, which are vital for the viral life cycle.
These G-quadruplex forming motifs (HGQs) in the G and L genes are potential drug targets, as they are involved in essential processes in the life cycle of the NiV. The researchers used a wet-lab approach to identify and characterize these motifs. They physically conducted non-computational experiments that included using biophysical and biochemical techniques such as NMR, CD, EMSA, and DMS footprinting assay to verify the existence and properties of the G-quadruplexes.

Title: A novel receptor-induced activation site in the Nipah virus attachment glycoprotein (G) involved in triggering the fusion glycoprotein (F)
Abstract: Cellular entry of paramyxoviruses requires the coordinated action of both the attachment (G/H/HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, but how receptor binding activates G to trigger F-mediated fusion during viral entry is not known.

We first generated a conformational monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 45 (Mab45)) whose binding to NiV-G was enhanced upon NiV-G-ephrinB2 binding. However, Mab45 also inhibited viral entry, and its receptor binding-enhanced (RBE) epitope was temperature-dependent, suggesting that the Mab45 RBE epitope on G may be involved in triggering F. The Mab45 RBE epitope was mapped to the base of the globular domain (beta6S4/beta1H1). Alanine scan mutants within this region that did not exhibit this RBE epitope were also non-fusogenic despite their ability to bind ephrinB2, oligomerize, and associate with F at wild-type (WT) levels. Although circular dichroism revealed conformational changes in the soluble ectodomain of WT NiV-G upon ephrinB2 addition, no such changes were detected with soluble RBE epitope mutants or short-stalk G mutants. Additionally, WT G, but not a RBE epitope mutant, could dissociate from F upon ephrinB2 engagement. Finally, using a biotinylated HR2 peptide to detect pre-hairpin intermediate formation, a cardinal feature of F-triggering, we showed that ephrinB2 binding to WT G, but not the RBE-epitope mutants, could trigger F. In sum, we implicate the coordinated interaction between the base of NiV-G globular head domain and the stalk domain in mediating receptor-induced F triggering during viral entry.","This paper identifies a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The researchers have uncovered an interaction between the Nipah virus (NiV) glycoprotein (G) and the cellular receptor (ephrinB2) that seems to be crucial for the viral entry into host cells. The identified target is an allosteric activation site in the NiV-G protein, which is involved in triggering F-mediated fusion. The researchers discovered this site through wet-lab experimental methods, including the generation of a conformational monoclonal antibody (Mab45), which was observed to have enhanced binding to NiV-G upon NiV-G-ephrinB2 binding. This Mab45 was also found to inhibit viral entry, suggesting its binding site on the NiV-G protein may be involved in triggering the F protein and thus, the fusion process required for viral entry.
In addition to this, the authors conducted experiments using alanine scanning mutagenesis, which is a method of systematically mutating specific amino acids in a protein to study their function. Through this method, they identified that mutants within the region that did not exhibit the receptor binding-enhanced (RBE) epitope were non-fusogenic, despite their ability to bind to the ephrinB2 receptor and associate with the F protein at wild-type levels. This implies the importance of the RBE epitope in the triggering of F protein and viral fusion, indicating it as a potential drug target.
Also, the study used circular dichroism (a biophysical technique) to detect conformational changes in the soluble ectodomain of WT NiV-G upon ephrinB2 addition, further indicating this interaction as a potential point of therapeutic intervention. The authors also noted that wild-type G, but not an RBE epitope mutant, could dissociate from F upon ephrinB2 engagement, demonstrating the essential role of the RBE epitope in the fusion process.
Moreover, the paper used a biotinylated HR2 peptide to detect pre-hairpin intermediate formation, a hallmark of F-triggering, demonstrating that ephrinB2 binding to WT G, but not the RBE-epitope mutants, could trigger F. This additional evidence supports the proposed role of the RBE epitope in triggering F, and thus viral fusion, further suggesting its potential as a drug target.

Title: Identification of a broad-spectrum antiviral small molecule against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses by using a novel high-throughput screening assay
Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses are members of different viral families and are known causative agents of fatal viral diseases. These viruses depend on cathepsin L for entry into their target cells. The viral glycoproteins need to be primed by protease cleavage, rendering them active for fusion with the host cell membrane. In this study, we developed a novel high-throughput screening assay based on peptides, derived from the glycoproteins of the aforementioned viruses, which contain the cathepsin L cleavage site. We screened a library of 5,000 small molecules and discovered a small molecule that can inhibit the cathepsin L cleavage of all viral peptides with minimal inhibition of cleavage of a host protein-derived peptide (pro-neuropeptide Y). The small molecule inhibited the entry of all pseudotyped viruses in vitro and the cleavage of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in an in vitro cleavage assay. In addition, the Hendra and Nipah virus fusion glycoproteins were not cleaved in the presence of the small molecule in a cell-based cleavage assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the small molecule is a mixed inhibitor of cathepsin L. Our broad-spectrum antiviral small molecule appears to be an ideal candidate for future optimization and development into a potent antiviral against SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses. Importance: We developed a novel high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecules that can prevent cathepsin L cleavage of viral glycoproteins derived from SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses that are required for their entry into the host cell. We identified a novel broad-spectrum small molecule that could block cathepsin L-mediated cleavage and thus inhibit the entry of pseudotypes bearing the glycoprotein derived from SARS-CoV or Ebola, Hendra, or Nipah virus. The small molecule can be further optimized and developed into a potent broad-spectrum antiviral drug.","This paper does identify an existing drug target using a wet-lab approach. The drug target in this study is cathepsin L, a protease enzyme in the host body that these viruses (SARS-CoV, Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah) depend on for entry into their target cells. The viruses require cathepsin L to cleave their glycoproteins, a necessary step to prepare these glycoproteins for fusion with the host cell membrane, allowing viral entry.
The researchers devised a novel high-throughput screening assay that is based on peptides derived from the glycoproteins of the aforementioned viruses, which contain the cathepsin L cleavage site. This assay serves as a wet-lab approach because it involves physically conducting experiments to test the inhibition of cathepsin L by different small molecules.
In this study, a library of 5,000 small molecules was screened, and a small molecule was found that inhibits the cathepsin L cleavage of all viral peptides. It showed minimal inhibition of cleavage of a host protein-derived peptide (pro-neuropeptide Y), suggesting that it's specifically targeting the viral process. This inhibition was confirmed through multiple in vitro assays, such as a cleavage assay and a cell-based cleavage assay.
Therefore, cathepsin L, which is essential for viral entry into the host cell, was identified as a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach, with the researchers finding a small molecule that can inhibit its function.

Title: Inhibition of Henipavirus fusion and infection by heptad-derived peptides of the Nipah virus fusion glycoprotein
Abstract: Background: The recent emergence of four new members of the paramyxovirus family has heightened the awareness of and re-energized research on new and emerging diseases. In particular, the high mortality and person to person transmission associated with the most recent Nipah virus outbreaks, as well as the very recent re-emergence of Hendra virus, has confirmed the importance of developing effective therapeutic interventions. We have previously shown that peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR-2) of the fusion envelope glycoprotein of Hendra virus and Nipah virus were potent inhibitors of both Hendra virus and Nipah virus-mediated membrane fusion using recombinant expression systems. In the current study, we have developed shorter, second generation HR-2 peptides which include a capped peptide via amidation and acetylation and two poly(ethylene glycol)-linked (PEGylated) peptides, one with the PEG moity at the C-terminus and the other at the N-terminus. Here, we have evaluated these peptides as well as the corresponding scrambled peptide controls in Nipah virus and Hendra virus-mediated membrane fusion and against infection by live virus in vitro. Results: Unlike their predecessors, the second generation HR-2 peptides exhibited high solubility and improved synthesis yields. Importantly, both Nipah virus and Hendra virus-mediated fusion as well as live virus infection were potently inhibited by both capped and PEGylated peptides with IC50 concentrations similar to the original HR-2 peptides, whereas the scrambled modified peptides had no inhibitory effect. These data also indicate that these chemical modifications did not alter the functional properties of the peptides as inhibitors. Conclusion: Nipah virus and Hendra virus infection in vitro can be potently blocked by specific HR-2 peptides. The improved synthesis and solubility characteristics of the second generation HR-2 peptides will facilitate peptide synthesis for pre-clinical trial application in an animal model of Henipavirus infection. The applied chemical modifications are also predicted to increase the serum half-life in vivo and should increase the chance of success in the development of an effective antiviral therapy.","This paper discusses the development and testing of peptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR-2) of the fusion envelope glycoprotein of Hendra and Nipah viruses. These peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit both Hendra and Nipah virus-mediated membrane fusion, and for their ability to prevent infection by the live viruses in vitro.
The fusion envelope glycoprotein of the viruses, from which the peptides were derived, is essentially the focus of this study. This protein plays a critical role in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, a process that is necessary for the virus to enter host cells and initiate infection. As such, it is considered a key step in the viral lifecycle and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
The researchers used a wet-lab approach to test the inhibitory action of these peptides. They carried out in vitro experiments to assess the peptides' ability to inhibit membrane fusion mediated by the viruses and to prevent infection by the live viruses.
Therefore, this paper identifies the fusion envelope glycoprotein of Hendra and Nipah viruses as a potential drug target, and it uses a wet-lab approach to test peptides derived from this protein for their ability to inhibit virus activity.

Title: A small-molecule inhibitor of Nipah virus envelope protein-mediated membrane fusion
Abstract: Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, causes respiratory disease in pigs and severe febrile encephalitis in humans with high mortality rates. On the basis of the structural similarity of viral fusion (F) proteins within the family Paramyxoviridae, we designed and tested 18 quinolone derivatives in a NiV and measles virus (MV) envelope protein-based fusion assay beside evaluation of cytotoxicity. We found five compounds successfully inhibiting NiV envelope protein-induced cell fusion. The most active molecules (19 and 20), which also inhibit the syncytium formation induced by infectious NiV and show a low cytotoxicity in Vero cells, represent a promising lead quinolone-type compound structure. Molecular modeling indicated that compound 19 fits well into a particular protein cavity present on the NiV F protein that is important for the fusion process.","This paper focuses on the inhibition of Nipah virus (NiV) envelope protein-induced cell fusion using small-molecule inhibitors, particularly quinolone derivatives. This work involves identifying molecules that can inhibit the function of the NiV envelope protein, specifically the viral fusion (F) protein.
The viral fusion (F) protein of NiV is a crucial component that facilitates the entry of the virus into host cells by mediating the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. In this paper, the researchers designed and tested 18 quinolone derivatives for their ability to inhibit NiV and measles virus (MV) envelope protein-based fusion. The assay used to determine this is a wet-lab approach, specifically an in vitro assay. The researchers found five compounds that successfully inhibited NiV envelope protein-induced cell fusion, indicating that these molecules could potentially inhibit the NiV infection process.
The most active compounds, 19 and 20, also inhibited the syncytium formation induced by infectious NiV and showed low cytotoxicity in Vero cells. Syncytium formation is a characteristic feature of NiV infection and involves the fusion of an infected cell with neighboring cells to form a large, multinucleated cell, or syncytium.
Moreover, molecular modeling indicated that compound 19 fits well into a particular protein cavity present on the NiV F protein that is important for the fusion process. This evidence suggests that the F protein of the NiV could be a potential drug target.
In conclusion, this study identified the viral fusion (F) protein of the NiV as a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. This protein was targeted using quinolone derivatives, which were shown to inhibit NiV envelope protein-induced cell fusion and syncytium formation.

Title: Potent Henipavirus Neutralization by Antibodies Recognizing Diverse Sites on Hendra and Nipah Virus Receptor Binding Protein
Keywords: B lymphocytes; Hendra virus; Henipavirus infections; Nipah virus; antibodies; antigen-antibody reactions; epitopes; molecular structure; monoclonal; pre-exposure prophylaxis; receptor binding protein; therapy; viral.
Abstract: Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens in the Henipavirus genus causing outbreaks of disease with very high case fatality rates. Here, we report the first naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HeV receptor binding protein (RBP). All isolated mAbs neutralized HeV, and some also neutralized NiV. Epitope binning experiments identified five major antigenic sites on HeV-RBP. Animal studies demonstrated that the most potent cross-reactive neutralizing mAbs, HENV-26 and HENV-32, protected ferrets in lethal models of infection with NiV Bangladesh 3 days after exposure. We solved the crystal structures of mAb HENV-26 in complex with both HeV-RBP and NiV-RBP and of mAb HENV-32 in complex with HeV-RBP. The studies reveal diverse sites of vulnerability on RBP recognized by potent human mAbs that inhibit virus by multiple mechanisms. These studies identify promising prophylactic antibodies and define protective epitopes that can be used in rational vaccine design.","The paper presented identifies the receptor binding protein (RBP) of Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The authors use a wet-lab approach to investigate this by isolating human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can neutralize HeV and NiV through binding to their respective RBPs. They further explore the specific antigenic sites (epitopes) on HeV-RBP that these antibodies bind to, thereby highlighting potential sites of vulnerability on the virus. This information can be crucial in drug design, where molecules can be developed to specifically interact with these sites, inhibiting the virus's ability to infect host cells.
Furthermore, the authors performed wet-lab animal studies to test the therapeutic potential of two particularly potent neutralizing mAbs, HENV-26 and HENV-32. These antibodies were able to protect ferrets from lethal infection with NiV Bangladesh 3 days post exposure. The authors also used wet-lab techniques to solve the crystal structures of mAbs HENV-26 and HENV-32 in complex with the RBPs of HeV and NiV, respectively. Understanding these structures can provide further insights into the interaction between the antibody and RBP, which can aid in the design of therapeutic agents targeting these interactions.
In summary, the paper does identify the RBP of HeV and NiV as a potential drug target using wet-lab approaches. These approaches include the isolation and testing of human mAbs, epitope binning experiments, animal studies, and the determination of antibody-RBP complex structures.

Title: An antibody against the F glycoprotein inhibits Nipah and Hendra virus infections
Abstract: Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness with fatality rates of 50-100%. No vaccines or licensed therapeutics currently exist to protect humans against NiV or HeV. HNVs enter host cells by fusing the viral and cellular membranes via the concerted action of the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, the main targets of the humoral immune response. Here, we describe the isolation and humanization of a potent monoclonal antibody cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy, triggering and fusion studies show the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope, conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins, and prevents membrane fusion and viral entry. This work supports the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response and paves the way for using this antibody for prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy with NiV- and HeV-infected individuals.","This paper identifies a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach. The target is the prefusion conformation of the fusion (F) glycoprotein on Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). The study has identified an antibody that binds to a specific site (quaternary epitope) on the F glycoprotein, which is conserved in both NiV and HeV. This binding prevents the process of membrane fusion and subsequently inhibits the viral entry into host cells.
The wet-lab approach in this study can be inferred from several experimental techniques that have been employed. Cryo-electron microscopy is a wet-lab technique used to visualize the structural details of the complex formed by the antibody and the F glycoprotein. This helps the researchers understand the mechanism by which the antibody inhibits the virus. Triggering and fusion studies were also likely performed experimentally in a wet-lab setting to determine how the antibody interferes with the virus's ability to enter host cells.
The paper also states that this work supports the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response, suggesting that this conformation of the F glycoprotein could be a target for vaccine development. Furthermore, the antibody described in the paper is suggested to have potential use for prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy in NiV- and HeV-infected individuals, which implies that it could also be considered a drug candidate. Therefore, this paper does identify a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Molecular determinants of antiviral potency of paramyxovirus entry inhibitors
Abstract: Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) constitute the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses, both fatal in humans and with the potential for subversion as agents of bioterrorism. Binding of the HeV/NiV attachment protein (G) to its receptor triggers a series of conformational changes in the fusion protein (F), ultimately leading to formation of a postfusion six-helix bundle (6HB) structure and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The ectodomain of paramyxovirus F proteins contains two conserved heptad repeat regions, the first (the N-terminal heptad repeat [HRN]) adjacent to the fusion peptide and the second (the C-terminal heptad repeat [HRC]) immediately preceding the transmembrane domain. Peptides derived from the HRN and HRC regions of F are proposed to inhibit fusion by preventing activated F molecules from forming the 6HB structure that is required for fusion. We previously reported that a human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) F peptide effectively inhibits infection mediated by the HeV glycoproteins in pseudotyped-HeV entry assays more effectively than the comparable HeV-derived peptide, and we now show that this peptide inhibits live-HeV and -NiV infection. HPIV3 F peptides were also effective in inhibiting HeV pseudotype virus entry in a new assay that mimics multicycle replication. This anti-HeV/NiV efficacy can be correlated with the greater potential of the HPIV3 C peptide to interact with the HeV F N peptide coiled-coil trimer, as evaluated by thermal unfolding experiments. Furthermore, replacement of a buried glutamic acid (glutamic acid 459) in the C peptide with valine enhances antiviral potency and stabilizes the 6HB conformation. Our results strongly suggest that conserved interhelical packing interactions in the F protein fusion core are important determinants of C peptide inhibitory activity and offer a strategy for the development of more-potent analogs of F peptide inhibitors.","The paper talks about a mechanism to inhibit the fusion process of the Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), which are both in the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses. The process of viral entry into the host cell is mediated by two proteins: the attachment protein (G) and the fusion protein (F). The paper discusses that the fusion protein (F) plays a key role in the virus entry mechanism by undergoing conformational changes leading to the formation of a postfusion six-helix bundle (6HB) structure, which is crucial for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
In this study, the authors have identified the F protein's two heptad repeat regions, HRN and HRC, as areas of interest. They propose that peptides derived from these regions could potentially inhibit the fusion process by preventing the formation of the 6HB structure required for fusion.
They have further demonstrated that a human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) F peptide is able to effectively inhibit the infection mediated by the HeV glycoproteins and live-HeV and -NiV infections. They have also mentioned a specific amino acid change (glutamic acid 459 to valine) that increases the antiviral potency of the peptide and stabilizes the 6HB conformation.
It's worth mentioning that the paper discusses experiments involving pseudotyped-HeV entry assays and live-HeV and -NiV infections, suggesting a wet-lab approach. They have also used a method that mimics multicycle replication and thermal unfolding experiments, which are examples of in vitro assays, a part of the wet-lab approach.
The protein fusion core (especially the heptad repeat regions) and the peptides derived from these regions that can potentially inhibit the fusion process represent existing or potential drug targets.

Title: Exceptionally potent cross-reactive neutralization of Nipah and Hendra viruses by a human monoclonal antibody
Abstract: We have previously identified neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) by panning a large nonimmune antibody library against a soluble form of the HeV attachment-envelope glycoprotein G (sG HeV). One of these antibodies, m102, which exhibited the highest level of cross-reactive neutralization of both NiV and HeV G, was affinity maturated by light-chain shuffling combined with random mutagenesis of its heavy-chain variable domain and panning against sGHeV. One of the selected antibody Fab clones, m102.4, had affinity of binding to sGHeV that was equal to or higher than that of the other Fabs; it was converted to IgG1 and tested against infectious NiV and HeV. It exhibited exceptionally potent and cross-reactive inhibitory activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations below 0.04 and 0.6 microg/mL, respectively. The virus-neutralizing activity correlated with the binding affinity of the antibody to sG HeV and sG NiV. m102.4 bound a soluble form of NiV G (sG NiV) better than it bound sG HeV, and it neutralized NiV better than HeV, despite being originally selected against sG HeV. These results suggest that m102.4 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diseases caused by henipaviruses. It could be also used for prophylaxis and diagnosis, and as a research reagent.","The paper describes the identification and optimization of a human monoclonal antibody, m102.4, that demonstrates potent cross-reactive neutralization of both Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). It's important to note that the antibody itself, in this context, is not a drug target but a potential therapeutic agent. The drug target here would be the HeV attachment-envelope glycoprotein G (sG HeV) or NiV G (sG NiV), which the antibody is binding to in order to neutralize the virus.
The process of identifying and optimizing this antibody falls under the description of a ""wet-lab approach"". This approach, as defined, includes in vitro assays of binding, inhibition, or neutralization, among other methods. The paper outlines a process where the researchers pan a large nonimmune antibody library against a soluble form of the HeV attachment-envelope glycoprotein G (sG HeV), identify a promising antibody (m102), and then perform further rounds of optimization (light-chain shuffling and random mutagenesis of its heavy-chain variable domain) to enhance the antibody's affinity and neutralization potency.
While the paper does not explicitly mention structure determination by biophysical techniques or in vivo studies, the described methodology and experimental design clearly fall within the scope of wet-lab techniques. The paper outlines a classic example of in vitro study involving binding assays (determining the binding affinity of the antibody to sG HeV and sG NiV) and neutralization assays (testing the ability of the m102.4 antibody to inhibit infectious NiV and HeV).
In summary, although the paper does not necessarily identify a new drug target, it does employ a wet-lab approach to identify and optimize a potential therapeutic agent (m102.4) against an already known drug target (the HeV and NiV glycoproteins).

Title: Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus
Abstract: Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) belong to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae and are unique in that they exhibit a broad species tropism and cause fatal disease in both animals and humans. They infect cells through a pH-independent membrane fusion process mediated by their fusion and attachment glycoproteins. Previously, we demonstrated identical cell fusion tropisms for HeV and NiV and the protease-sensitive nature of their unknown cell receptor and identified a human cell line (HeLa-USU) that was nonpermissive for fusion and virus infection. Here, a microarray analysis was performed on the HeLa-USU cells, permissive HeLa-CCL2 cells, and two other permissive human cell lines. From this analysis, we identified a list of genes encoding known and predicted plasma membrane surface-expressed proteins that were highly expressed in all permissive cells and absent from the HeLa-USU cells and rank-ordered them based on their relative levels. Available expression vectors containing the first 10 genes were obtained and individually transfected into HeLa-USU cells. One clone, encoding human ephrin-B2 (EFNB2), was found capable of rendering HeLa-USU cells permissive for HeV- and NiV-mediated cell fusion as well as infection by live virus. A soluble recombinant EFNB2 could potently block fusion and infection and bind soluble recombinant HeV and NiV attachment glycoproteins with high affinity. Together, these data indicate that EFNB2 serves as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV. The highly conserved nature of EFNB2 in humans and animals is consistent with the broad tropism exhibited by these emerging zoonotic viruses.","This paper identifies the human ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) as a functional receptor for both Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). The identification was made through wet-lab experimental techniques as described in the user-provided definition: physically conducting non-computational experiments. These methods involved microarray analysis of different human cell lines and an examination of genes encoding known and predicted plasma membrane surface-expressed proteins. The authors further validated their findings by using expression vectors containing these genes and transfecting them into a non-permissive human cell line, HeLa-USU. After the transfection with the EFNB2 gene, these cells became permissive for HeV and NiV mediated cell fusion as well as infection by live virus. Additionally, a soluble recombinant EFNB2 was found to potently block fusion and infection and bind soluble recombinant HeV and NiV attachment glycoproteins with high affinity.
A drug target, as defined, is a macromolecule in the body associated with a disease process to which a drug is directed and/or binds, resulting in a therapeutic effect. In this context, EFNB2 could be considered a potential drug target for HeV and NiV. The function of EFNB2 as a receptor for these viruses is crucial for their ability to infect human cells, and therefore, interventions that could inhibit or block the interaction between EFNB2 and these viruses could potentially provide a therapeutic benefit. Therefore, the EFNB2 receptor represents a potential drug target that has been identified through wet-lab experimental techniques.

Title: A mature and fusogenic form of the Nipah virus fusion protein requires proteolytic processing by cathepsin L
Abstract: The Nipah virus fusion (F) protein is proteolytically processed to F1 + F2 subunits. We demonstrate here that cathepsin L is involved in this important maturation event. Cathepsin inhibitors ablated cleavage of Nipah F. Proteolytic processing of Nipah F and fusion activity was dramatically reduced in cathepsin L shRNA-expressing Vero cells. Additionally, Nipah virus F-mediated fusion was inhibited in cathepsin L-deficient cells, but coexpression of cathepsin L restored fusion activity. Both purified cathepsin L and B could cleave immunopurified Nipah F protein, but only cathepsin L produced products of the correct size. Our results suggest that endosomal cathepsins can cleave Nipah F, but that cathepsin L specifically converts Nipah F to a mature and fusogenic form.","The paper focuses on the role of cathepsin L, a protease, in the proteolytic processing of the Nipah virus fusion (F) protein. The F protein is critical to the Nipah virus' capacity to enter and infect host cells, and it becomes functional only after proteolytic processing into F1 + F2 subunits. This cleavage process, the paper shows, is mediated by cathepsin L. The evidence comes from a series of wet-lab experiments, such as cathepsin inhibitors that stopped the cleavage of Nipah F, and shRNA-induced suppression of cathepsin L in Vero cells that significantly reduced both the proteolytic processing of Nipah F and fusion activity.
The inhibition of Nipah F-mediated fusion in cathepsin L-deficient cells provides a potential target for drug development. If cathepsin L's activity can be inhibited, then the Nipah F protein cannot be processed and the virus may lose its infectivity. This highlights cathepsin L as a potential drug target.
This paper identifies a potential drug target (cathepsin L) using a wet-lab approach. The researchers use experimental methods to demonstrate the key role of cathepsin L in the maturation of the Nipah virus fusion protein, which suggests that inhibiting this process could be a potential therapeutic strategy against the Nipah virus.

Title: A structural basis for antibody-mediated neutralization of Nipah virus reveals a site of vulnerability at the fusion glycoprotein apex
Keywords: antibody response; glycoprotein; henipavirus; structure; viral fusion.
Abstract: Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes frequent outbreaks of severe neurologic and respiratory disease in humans with high case fatality rates. The 2 glycoproteins displayed on the surface of the virus, NiV-G and NiV-F, mediate host-cell attachment and membrane fusion, respectively, and are targets of the host antibody response. Here, we provide a molecular basis for neutralization of NiV through antibody-mediated targeting of NiV-F. Structural characterization of a neutralizing antibody (nAb) in complex with trimeric prefusion NiV-F reveals an epitope at the membrane-distal domain III (DIII) of the molecule, a region that undergoes substantial refolding during host-cell entry. The epitope of this monoclonal antibody (mAb66) is primarily protein-specific and we observe that glycosylation at the periphery of the interface likely does not inhibit mAb66 binding to NiV-F. Further characterization reveals that a Hendra virus-F-specific nAb (mAb36) and many antibodies in an antihenipavirus-F polyclonal antibody mixture (pAb835) also target this region of the molecule. Integrated with previously reported paramyxovirus F-nAb structures, these data support a model whereby the membrane-distal region of the F protein is targeted by the antibody-mediated immune response across henipaviruses. Notably, our domain-specific sequence analysis reveals no evidence of selective pressure at this region of the molecule, suggestive that functional constraints prevent immune-driven sequence variation. Combined, our data reveal the membrane-distal region of NiV-F as a site of vulnerability on the NiV surface.","The paper describes the identification and characterization of a region on the fusion glycoprotein (NiV-F) of the Nipah virus that appears to be a site of vulnerability. This vulnerability was discovered through the study of how a neutralizing antibody (mAb66) interacts with the NiV-F. The region identified, referred to as the membrane-distal domain III (DIII), undergoes significant changes during the process of host-cell entry. Therefore, it may be critical to the ability of the virus to infect host cells.
Structural characterization of the interaction between mAb66 and NiV-F was performed, providing a molecular-level understanding of the site of antibody binding. Additionally, the paper indicates that the region identified is also targeted by antibodies from a related virus (Hendra virus) and by many antibodies in an anti-henipavirus polyclonal mixture. This further underscores the potential significance of this region in the context of the immune response.
The methods used to identify and characterize this site of vulnerability, including structural determination of antibody binding, fall within the definition of a wet-lab approach as provided. Therefore, the paper uses a wet-lab approach to identify a potential drug target.
Final answer: Yes. The paper identifies a potential drug target using a wet-lab approach.

Title: Endothelial galectin-1 binds to specific glycans on nipah virus fusion protein and inhibits maturation, mobility, and function to block syncytia formation
Abstract: Nipah virus targets human endothelial cells via NiV-F and NiV-G envelope glycoproteins, resulting in endothelial syncytia formation and vascular compromise. Endothelial cells respond to viral infection by releasing innate immune effectors, including galectins, which are secreted proteins that bind to specific glycan ligands on cell surface glycoproteins. We demonstrate that galectin-1 reduces NiV-F mediated fusion of endothelial cells, and that endogenous galectin-1 in endothelial cells is sufficient to inhibit syncytia formation. Galectin-1 regulates NiV-F mediated cell fusion at three distinct points, including retarding maturation of nascent NiV-F, reducing NiV-F lateral mobility on the plasma membrane, and directly inhibiting the conformational change in NiV-F required for triggering fusion. Characterization of the NiV-F N-glycome showed that the critical site for galectin-1 inhibition is rich in glycan structures known to bind galectin-1. These studies identify a unique set of mechanisms for regulating pathophysiology of NiV infection at the level of the target cell.","This paper presents research on the interaction between galectin-1, a protein found in endothelial cells, and the Nipah virus fusion protein (NiV-F). The research shows that galectin-1 inhibits the formation of syncytia, or fused cells, which is a typical effect of the Nipah virus infection.
The molecular interactions studied in the paper occur at several levels. First, galectin-1 is found to retard the maturation of nascent NiV-F, slowing the development of the virus. Second, galectin-1 reduces the lateral mobility of NiV-F on the plasma membrane, impairing the virus's ability to move and interact with host cells. Finally, galectin-1 directly inhibits the conformational change in NiV-F necessary for triggering cell fusion.
From a drug target perspective, it's important to note that a drug target is typically a macromolecule in the body associated with a disease process, and to which a drug is directed and/or binds, resulting in a therapeutic effect. In this case, galectin-1 and NiV-F could both be considered potential drug targets. Galectin-1, as it naturally binds to NiV-F and inhibits its function, could be targeted to increase its production or activity. On the other hand, NiV-F could be targeted by a drug designed to mimic the inhibitory effects of galectin-1.
The research presented in the paper uses a wet-lab approach, involving in vitro studies on human endothelial cells, examining the effect of galectin-1 on the NiV-F protein and the resulting syncytia formation. This type of approach involves physically conducting non-computational experiments.
Final Answer: Yes, this paper does identify potential drug targets using a wet-lab approach. Galectin-1 and the Nipah virus fusion protein (NiV-F) can be seen as potential drug targets in the context of Nipah virus infection.

Title: Identification of the nuclear export signal and STAT-binding domains of the Nipah virus V protein reveals mechanisms underlying interferon evasion
Abstract: The V proteins of Nipah virus and Hendra virus have been demonstrated to bind to cellular STAT1 and STAT2 proteins to form high-molecular-weight complexes that inhibit interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral transcription by preventing STAT nuclear accumulation. Analysis of the Nipah virus V protein has revealed a region between amino acids 174 and 192 that functions as a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). This peptide is sufficient to complement an export-defective human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein, and deletion and substitution mutagenesis revealed that this peptide is necessary for both V protein shuttling and cytoplasmic retention of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. However, the NES is not required for V-dependent IFN signaling inhibition. IFN signaling is blocked primarily by interaction between Nipah virus V residues 100 to 160 and STAT1 residues 509 to 712. Interaction with STAT2 requires a larger Nipah virus V segment between amino acids 100 and 300, but deletion of residues 230 to 237 greatly reduced STAT2 coprecipitation. Further, V protein interactions with cellular STAT1 is a prerequisite for STAT2 binding, and sequential immunoprecipitations demonstrate that V, STAT1, and STAT2 can form a tripartite complex. These findings characterize essential regions for Henipavirus V proteins that represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","The paper presented focuses on the V protein of the Nipah virus, which is a mechanism by which the virus evades the immune response of the host organism. This evasion is carried out by the V protein's ability to bind to the cellular proteins STAT1 and STAT2, forming high-molecular-weight complexes that inhibit interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral transcription by preventing STAT proteins' nuclear accumulation. This binding and inhibition prevent the activation of the immune response against the virus.
From a molecular perspective, the paper identifies specific sequences of amino acids within the V protein that are crucial for its interaction with STAT1 and STAT2. These specific sequences could be considered potential drug targets since a drug that can inhibit this interaction might prevent the viral immune evasion mechanism and allow the host's immune system to effectively fight the infection.
However, it is important to note that the identification of these regions is based on in vitro experimentation and analyses, which can be classified as a wet-lab approach. They explored the sequences of the V protein and how changes in those sequences affected the protein's interactions with STAT1 and STAT2. This type of experiment would have required the physical manipulation of the V protein and potentially the use of techniques such as genetic manipulation or in vitro binding assays to determine the impacts of these changes.
The paper identifies potential drug targets (specific regions of the Nipah virus V protein) using a wet-lab approach. Final Answer: Yes.

Title: Host cell recognition by the henipaviruses: crystal structures of the Nipah G attachment glycoprotein and its complex with ephrin-B3
Abstract: Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus are the type species of the highly pathogenic paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus, which can cause severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis infections in humans, with case fatality rates approaching 75%. NiV contains two envelope glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G glycoprotein (NiV-G) that facilitates attachment to host cells and the fusion (F) glycoprotein that mediates membrane merger. The henipavirus G glycoproteins lack both hemagglutinating and neuraminidase activities and, instead, engage the highly conserved ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 cell surface proteins as their entry receptors. Here, we report the crystal structures of the NiV-G both in its receptor-unbound state and in complex with ephrin-B3, providing, to our knowledge, the first view of a paramyxovirus attachment complex in which a cellular protein is used as the virus receptor. Complex formation generates an extensive protein-protein interface around a protruding ephrin loop, which is inserted in the central cavity of the NiV-G beta-propeller. Analysis of the structural data reveals the molecular basis for the highly specific interactions of the henipavirus G glycoproteins with only two members (ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3) of the very large ephrin family and suggests how they mediate in a unique fashion both cell attachment and the initiation of membrane fusion during the virus infection processes. The structures further suggest that the NiV-G/ephrin interactions can be effectively targeted to disrupt viral entry and provide the foundation for structure-based antiviral drug design.","The paper focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of how the Nipah virus (NiV) infects host cells. It highlights the role of the virus's receptor-binding G glycoprotein (NiV-G) and its interaction with host cell proteins ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, which serve as entry receptors for the virus. This investigation was made possible by the determination of the crystal structures of NiV-G both in its receptor-unbound state and in complex with ephrin-B3.
By doing this, the researchers essentially used a wet-lab approach. Crystallography, which was employed to understand the structures of these proteins, is a biophysical technique that falls under wet-lab research as it involves physical experimental procedures.
The detailed analysis of these structures and their interaction provides a molecular basis for the highly specific interactions of the henipavirus G glycoproteins with only two members (ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3) of the large ephrin family. This insight is fundamental in understanding the virus infection process, including how cell attachment and initiation of membrane fusion are uniquely mediated.
The researchers suggest that the NiV-G/ephrin interactions can be effectively targeted to disrupt viral entry. This suggests that NiV-G, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3 may be considered potential drug targets, as interfering with their interaction could potentially inhibit the virus's ability to infect host cells. Therefore, although the paper does not directly mention testing a specific drug or compound against these targets, it lays the groundwork for potential antiviral drug design based on these findings.
Final Answer: Yes, this paper identifies potential drug targets (NiV-G, ephrin-B2, and ephrin-B3) using a wet-lab approach.
